<h2>PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION.</h2>


<p>These pages attempt to make better known the large part of Ireland which
is served by the Great Southern and Western Railway Company, and while
doing so to realise Shakespeare's words:</p>

<p class='center'>
"An honest tale speeds best being plainly told."
</p>

<p>If they succeed in these endeavours, they will satisfy the compiler. No
inexorable route is insisted upon, but no suggestion is stinted which
may help the tourist to enjoy fully the beautiful country he passes
through&mdash;and a beautiful country it truly is, be it approached from
Athlone, its north-western gate, by the Shannon, where,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"In the quiet watered land, the land of roses,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Stands Saint Kieran's city fair,"</span><br />
</p>

<p>or from its south-western side, in the kingdom of Kerry, where the ocean
leans against the mountains, and the storm-swept peak of Skellig Michael
makes the most westerly citadel of Christ in the Old World! Everywhere
within its broad borders, swift-rushing rivers, mirror-like lakes, and
mountains tiaraed in the skies, delight the vision and gladden the
heart.</p>

<p>The Gaelic names of places are usually word pictures reflecting with
fidelity the physical features of each place, or "tell sad stories of
the death of kings." Where possible, the equivalents have been given in
English.</p>

<p>With these forewords, nothing further remains but to offer an Irish
welcome&mdash;</p>

<h2>PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION.</h2>


<p>Since "The Sunny Side of Ireland" was issued the Royal Assent has been
given to an Act of Parliament which makes the Great Southern and Western
Railway foremost in every sense amongst Irish Railways. The two
Provinces of Munster and Connaught are now knit together by a huge
network of railway lines comprised in their amalgamated system.</p>

<p>The several counties thus included are dealt with in this Second
Edition. The volume is further enhanced by more particular information
as to the sports and pastimes of the country, and by a valuable chapter
on the Natural History of the South and West of Ireland, by writers of
authority on such subjects.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<h2>Introduction.</h2>

<p>Travelling through Ireland in the good old times was at best a
precarious and inconvenient diversion. Those who had to do so regretted
the necessity, and those who had not, praised Providence. Many "persons
of quality," to use Dr. Johnson's phrase, have written narratives of
their adventures and experiences in "the most damnable country." No man
of position, even early in the nineteenth century, would dream of
travelling threescore miles from his residence without having signed and
sealed his last will and testament. The highways were beset by
"Gentlemen of the Road," such as that fascinating felon, "Brennan on the
Moor," of whom the ballad tells&mdash;</p>

<p class='center'>
"A brace of loaded pistols he carried night and day."
</p>

<p>The coach roads were dangerous, the stage was deplorable, and everything
but the scenery unpleasant. The interior and west of the country were
connected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> with Dublin by canals cut in the time of the Irish
Parliament, which followed the enterprise of the Dutch. They were looked
upon at the time as feats of engineering skill, somewhat in the light
that we view the Suez or Panama Canals to-day. Neville, the engineer,
was the recipient of extravagant encomiums from the Lords and Commons,
and his fame is embalmed in a street ballad which sings the praise of&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Bold Neville,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Who made the streams run level</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In that bounding river</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Called the Grand Canal."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Nowadays we have changed all that, and Neville and his skill are as
little remembered in Ireland as the military-road cutter in Scotland, of
whom, to show that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
Ireland had not the monopoly in "bulls," an English admirer wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"If you had seen those roads before they</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Were made,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">You would hold up your hands and bless</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">General Wade."</span><br />
</p>

         <b>G. S. &amp; W. R. Corridor Train.</b>
    </div>

<p>A poor Italian boy&mdash;Charles Bianconi&mdash;who tramped through the country as
a print-seller, was the first, in the days of Waterloo, in the south of
Ireland, to begin really that healthy competition with the mail-coaches
which made straight the way for the Iron Horse.</p>

<p>The Great Southern and Western Railway was incorporated in 1845. Mr.
Under-Secretary Drummond, the English statesman who got closest to the
Irish heart, was identified with the construction of the line.</p>

<p>Year after year the Company prospered and increased, gradually absorbing
the smaller lines adjoining it until the year 1901, when it amalgamated
the only two other systems of broad gauge lines in their district which
had remained independent. Practically the two provinces of Munster and
Connaught are now knit together by the great network of railway lines
which comprise the Great Southern and Western System. The total length
is about 1,100 miles. The main line stretches from Dublin, through Cork,
to Queenstown, forming the route for the American Mails and the great
transatlantic passenger traffic. Branches extend to Waterford, Limerick,
Killarney, and Kerry, and every place of importance in the South of
Ireland, while in the west the line extends from Tralee, through
Limerick,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> to Sligo. The carriages which the Company provide are of the
very latest design; vestibule corridor trains, with dining and breakfast
cars, are run daily, and the speed of the trains will bear comparison
with any. The journey, Dublin to Cork (165 miles) is performed in four
hours; to Killarney (189 miles) in about fifteen minutes more, and all
the important tourist centres can be reached within a very short time.
The comfort of passengers is well arranged for; refreshment rooms are
provided at the principal stations, and breakfast, luncheon, and tea
baskets can always be had, as well as pillows, rugs, and all the modern
conveniences of travel. Besides all this, the enterprise of the Company
has provided at Killarney, Parknasilla, Kenmare,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> Caragh Lake, and
Waterville, hotels, which for appearance and luxury, tempered by
economy, are the equals of any in Europe.</p>

         <b>Interior of G. S. &amp; W. R. Dining Carriage.</b>
    </div>

<p>The scenery of Ireland surpasses the most roseate expectations. Within a
comparatively small compass her scenic beauties include mountains,
lakes, and seas, and it is the good fortune of the Great Southern and
Western Company to have within its borders the finest scenery in the
country. The "Skies of Erin" have been paid tribute to by artists again
and again. Turner said the sun never seemed to set so beautifully
anywhere as in Ireland, and Lady Butler, the well-known painter, has
expressed the opinion that nowhere, except in the valley of the Nile,
does the firmament put forth such varied changes of beauty as in
Ireland. To the Gulf Stream, which strikes the south-western coast,
scientists attribute the mildness of the climate. From Queenstown to
Leenane the coast-line contains countless health resorts, where invalids
may be recommended winter quarters as salubrious as many of the
continental districts.</p>

<p>The sportsman has always found himself at home here. The fine hunting
counties of Kildare, Tipperary, Kilkenny, and Waterford are familiar to
every son of Nimrod. Shooting and fishing, although the preserves are
not so many or so well kept as in Scotland, may be called the staple
sports of Ireland. Golf has come to stay, and within recent years links
have been laid in the vicinity of most of the tourist districts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>One word for Irish industries will not be out of place. Ireland has no
industries in the sense in which England has. With the exception of
Belfast, there is no place in the country which approaches to a factory
town in the sense in which that phrase is understood across the channel.
Agriculture, of course, is the backbone of Ireland, and in connection
with it the creamery system of the south may be mentioned. Anyone
anxious to find a line of industry in Ireland which has beaten the Dane
in his own market should visit Cleeves' famous factory at Limerick. The
woollen industry in the country has withstood destructive legislature,
and a typical example of modern success is the great tweed factory of
Morroghs, at Douglas, County Cork. The Blarney tweeds have become a
household word, but Douglas is shouldering them in the keen competition
for public recognition. The great bacon-curing houses of Denny, at
Waterford, are well worth seeing, as is also the thriving wholesome
Co-operative Factory at Tralee. In Dublin the mammoth brewery of
Guinness and Sons can be viewed under the conductorship of a servant of
the firm employed for the sole purpose of showing visitors through the
great concern. But it is the lesser industries in Ireland which are
really attractive. The law of the survival of the fittest stands to
these&mdash;the homespuns woven in the cottages, the beautiful Dublin poplin,
the delicate lace of Youghal and Limerick, the exquisite pottery of
Belleek, these good things are beyond compare.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<h2>Dublin and District.</h2>

<h3>DUBLIN.</h3>


<p>The Tourist too often hurries away from Dublin to the south or west with
but a superficial knowledge of the attractions of the city. It will well
repay a stay, and if the visitor happens to come at Horse Show week he
can easily believe himself sojourning in the capital of one of the
wealthiest countries in Europe. During that short carnival each autumn
the tears are brushed aside, and Erin is all smiles and welcomes for her
guests. The hotels are good, the lodging-houses are clean, and moderate
in price. The restaurants have much improved within recent years.
Readers of Lord Mayo's encouraging articles to would-be Irish tourists
will do well to test his tribute to "The Dolphin" in Essex-street. If
anyone wants to see the ladies of fashion at their tea, Mitchell's in
Grafton-street is a sure find, and the well-equipped D.B.C. tea-houses,
which are established in several parts of the city, will meet the
requirements of moderate purses.</p>

<p>To attempt to mention more than a few of the more important places worth
seeing in this city would be beyond the intention of these pages.
Stretched beneath<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> the beautiful Dublin Mountains the city scatters
itself about the sides of the River Liffey. To get from one place to
another in Dublin is simplicity itself. The electric-tram system is
equal to any in Europe, and excels most in the cheapness of its fares.
The cars run through the principal streets and along the quay sides to
the suburbs. A good view of the city may be had from the top of a tram
on a fine day. Those who wish to suit their own convenience, however,
will always avail themselves of the outside car. The jaunting car is to
Dublin what the gondola is to Venice&mdash;at least an imaginative Irish
Member of Parliament has said so, and that settles the matter. When
selecting an "outside" take care that you secure one equipped with a
pneumatic tyre. The Dublin driver is much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> maligned, he is generally
courteous, and not without humour. The municipal authorities supply him
with a list of fares and distances. He is bound to produce it should any
difficulty arise as to the financial relations, which sometimes happens.</p>

<h4>Shelbourne Hotel, Stephen's-green.</h4>

<p>Dublin was an old fortress of the Danes. They held the whole eastern
seaboard of Ireland until 1014 when Brian Boru defeated them and broke
their power at the battle of Clontarf. Historic remains of the old
city&mdash;the Ford of the Hurdles the Irish call it&mdash;there are none. The
Danes, the Normans, the Elizabethan, the Cromwellian, the Jacobite, all
made history in Dublin in their day, but the city as it stands is
practically modern. Between the Rotunda, one of the finest maternity
hospitals in the world, and St. Stephen's Green, the beautiful park
presented to the citizens by Lord Ardilaun, the principal buildings in
the city lie. The College Green, however, forms a natural centre from
which to make a short tour. The magnificent portico of the Bank of
Ireland&mdash;formerly the Irish House of Parliament&mdash;is characterized by
surprising dignity of proportion. Visitors can witness the printing of
bank notes. The Irish House of Lords, which remains unaltered, is an
oblong room with recess for throne at one end. Within may be seen two
valuable Dutch tapestries, the one representing the famous Siege of
Derry, and the second the Battle of the Boyne. Immediately outside "The
Old House at Home," as the historic building is affectionately called by
Irishmen, is a noble statue of Henry Grattan. He was the people's
darling from 1782, when the Volunteers mustered in College-green, up to
1800, when the Act of Union was passed. Behind Grattan stands the old
leaden statue of William III., erected in 1701. This equestrian figure
of "King Billy," as the prince of glorious, pious, and immortal memory
is familiarly known, has been the centre of, in its time, much mischief
and merriment. Up to 1822 His Majesty was annually decorated with orange
ribbons to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> celebrate the anniversary of the Battle of the Boyne. This
party demonstration was always resented by the populace, and King Billy
came in for no end of ill-treatment. However, he has braved the battle
and the breeze.</p>

<p>Turning from the Bank we face the University, in front of which stand
fine bronze statues of its distinguished sons, Edmund Burke and Oliver
Goldsmith. The University, unlike its sisters, Oxford and Cambridge,
contains but a single college&mdash;that of the Holy and Undivided
Trinity&mdash;founded by Adam Loftus in Elizabeth's reign. Visitors to the
College should be shown the chapel halls, museum, and library, and grand
quadrangles, including Lever's notorious "Botany Bay." While in the
library the world-famous "Book of Kells" may be inspected, and the
enduring qualities of its marvellous illuminations admired. The College
park is very beautiful, and during the College races at midsummer
presents quite a gala sight.</p>

<h4>Dublin Castle.</h4>

<p>In Dame-street most of the Irish banks have their offices. At the end of
the street furthest from the College is the City Hall. The building was
originally the Royal Exchange, but in the middle of the nineteenth
century it was handed over to the Dublin Corporation. The Corinthian
columns which form the portico are very handsome. The entrance is
modern, the older structure having given way in "the troubled times,"
while a crowd of citizens were beguiling the time watching a public
whipping of a malefactor from the steps. The centre hall is crowned with
a decorated dome. The hall contains statues of O'Connell,
Under-Secretary Drummond, Grattan, and Dr. Lucas, a publicist in
eighteen-century Dublin. The Council Chamber is well furnished, and some
of the portraits of former Lords Mayor are very fine. Immediately behind
the City Hall is Dublin Castle, far from being the imposing structure
those familiar with its history may suppose. The Lower Castle Yard is
entered from Palace-street.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> It contains the Birmingham Tower, a modern
structure replacing the fortress, some of the walls of which still
stand, from which the fiery Red Hugh O'Donel, Prince of Tyrone, escaped.
The Castle Chapel is beside the Tower, and permission to visit it is
easily obtained. Among the things of interest in the chapel are the
emblazoned arms of all the Irish viceroys. The wood work throughout is
Irish oak, and there are ninety heads in marble to represent the
sovereigns of England. St. Patrick's Hall, the Throne-room, and the Long
Drawing-room are the most important of the State apartments. While in
the vicinity of the Castle, St. Patrick's Cathedral should be visited.
Founded so long ago as 1190, this cathedral, dedicated to the Apostle of
Ireland, has had a chequered history. Mostly Early English in
architecture, modern styles have been grafted on the building without
consistency or unity of ideal. The monuments are many. Dean Swift's
bears an inscription written by himself and breathing the hatred of
oppression and love of liberty characteristic of the writer&mdash;</p>

<p>Hard by is a white marble slab in memory of her whose name must be for
ever associated with that of Swift&mdash;"Stella." Ten minutes' walk through
Patrick-street will bring one from St. Patrick's to the most interesting
ecclesiastical structure in Dublin&mdash;Christ Church Cathedral. An old
Danish foundation, fire and time laid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> hands upon the original
building. Its restoration is a triumph of architectural genius in the
reproduction of thirteenth-century English Gothic. Strongbow's tomb is
the famous monument of the place. The Crypt contains, besides other
antiquities, the old City stocks, which is some three centuries old.
Other places worth seeing in the city are the Four Courts, the Custom
House, the Pro-Cathedral, Marlborough-street, St. Michan's Church and
Churchyard, and the Church of St. Francis Xavier, Gardiner-street. The
general architecture in the streets is incongruous, and the modern
"improvements" not always desirable. In the back streets here and there
the quaint gables as old as Queen Anne still survive, but the Dutch
houses have almost entirely, and the Cage houses have entirely,
disappeared.</p>

<p>Leinster Lawn, or the Duke's Lawn, as the man in the street in Dublin
still calls it, contains, among other attractions, the National Gallery,
Museum, and Public Library. These are store houses of treasure. The
catalogue of the Gallery reveals a valuable collection of paintings, and
the Museum contains an unique exhibition of gold, silver, and bronze
ornaments, collars, brooches, shields, clasps, and spears, which were
found from time to time throughout Ireland, and are evidence of her
former civilization. The Royal Irish Academy, in Dawson-street,
possesses a rich collection of ancient Irish manuscript.</p>

<p>The cemeteries of Dublin are small, except Glasnevin. A drive through
the Ph&oelig;nix Park will bring one by the embanked river or through the
northern side of the city. An inquisitive tourist asked an Irish driver
why the Park was so called, when there was no such bird ever in the
world. "Sure that's the reason," said the driver. "Sure there's no such
Park in the world either." Lord Chesterfield put up a column with a
Ph&oelig;nix in the Park, but of old its name was Parc-na-Fionniake (the
field of the clear water). It lies on the northern bank of the river
celebrated by Sir Samuel Ferguson:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

</p>

<p>Long ago the St. John's Hospitallers had their house at Kilmainham, and
the lands belonging to the Order lay about either side of the stream.
The Hospice is now the Old Man's House&mdash;an Asylum for Disabled Soldiers,
designed by Sir Christopher Wren&mdash;and possesses one of the finest halls
in Europe. The lands have been built over at Inchicore, and on the other
side of the river formed into the Ph&oelig;nix Park, containing close on
two thousand acres, and bounded by a circumference of seven miles. The
Park contains the lodges of the Viceroy and the Chief Secretary for
Ireland, and the monuments to Lord Gough, Lord Carlisle, and the
"overgrown milestone," as the obelisk to the Duke of Wellington has been
called. The People's Gardens have been laid out with great taste, but
they cannot compare with the natural beauty of the Furze Glen with its
deep shade and silent lake. Visitors in the summer time should not fail
to drive from Knockmaroon gate, beside the Liffey, to "The Strawberry
Beds." Here, in the season, delicious fruit, fresh from the gardens, and
rich cream, can be had in most of the cottages beside the road.</p>


<h3>DUBLIN DISTRICT.</h3>

<h4>Round Tower and Church at Clondalkin.</h4>


<p>The country in the immediate vicinity of Dublin contains much that is
picturesque. The scenery along the coast has in general been already
referred to. But Killiney, Bray, and Howth, if time permits, should be
visited. The train and tram facilities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> are sufficient. Wicklow County
has been called the Garden of Erin, and on no account should a visit to
Glendalough or "The Meeting of the Waters" in the Vale of Avoca be
deferred. But those who wish to speed on to the south or west will do so
from the Kingsbridge Terminus. From here we pass through Inchicore, the
busy thriving hive of industry, where the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> Great Southern and Western
Railway have their engineering works. The first station we come to is
that of <b>Clondalkin</b>. The old village sits snuggled up at the foot of
its round tower, which is one of the best specimens of that early
architecture in Ireland, of which the poet says:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Two favourites hath Time&mdash;the Pyramids of Nile</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the old mystic temples of our own dear Isle."</span><br /></p>

<h4>Carton House, Maynooth.</h4>


<p>Irish antiquaries for generations have squabbled over these famous
"Pillar Towers of Ireland," but the general trend of scientific opinion
is that they are of early Christian origin. Father Matt Horgan, a famous
Munster antiquary, humorously started the theory that they were built to
puzzle posterity, which they have very successfully done. <b>Lucan</b> is a
health resort,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> possessing a sulphur spa, and situated in a well-wooded
country above the Liffey. The Hydropathic stands well sheltered and
commanding a splendid view. The drives in the district are many, and the
antiquarian will find much of interest. In Lord Annaly's demesne are the
remains of an early Norman castle, and in the vicinity is an ancient
Rath and souterraine. The drive to the Salmon Leap, at Leixlip, should
not be missed. Near by is <b>Castletown</b>, the palatial mansion of the
Connolly family, and a grotesque structure known as "Connolly's Folly,"
which was built in the time of the famine of "Black '47" to give
employment. Here, too, the great Dean of St. Patrick's beguiled his time
at "The Abbey," the home of Esther Vanhomrigh, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> "Vanessa" of his
strange life. From Lucan Maynooth may be reached. Here is St. Patrick's
National College for the education of priests for the Catholic Church,
originally founded on a Government grant. "Carton House," in the
vicinity, is the residence of the Dukes of Leinster. It is surrounded by
beautiful parks, well planted, among the trees the royal oaks, for which
Kildare was celebrated, being conspicuous. <b>Straffan</b> may be called a
"hunting village," as the meets of the famous "Killing Kildares" most
usually take place in its neighbourhood. Here, too, are the seats of
Lords Cloncurry and Mayo. The thriving market town of <b>Naas</b> is two
miles from Sallins, and is the railway station for Punchestown, the
great steeplechase<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> meeting of the Kildare Hunt. Long centuries ago it
was an historic spot&mdash;"Naas of the Kings." From the station may be seen
the Hill of Allen, rising like a sentinel on the mearings of the "Great
Plain of Ireland." <b>Harristown</b>, the second station on a branch line, is
about three miles from Poulaphouca Waterfall. The road to the Falls
leads through the picturesque village of Ballymore-Eustace, situated on
a bank at a bend in the river Liffey. The view from the river below the
Falls is very impressive. Tullow is the terminus of this branch of the
line. It is a good business town, and the river Slaney affords excellent
trout fishing. Within half-an-hour's walk from Sallins is Bodenstown
Churchyard, where Theobald Wolfe Tone, the founder of the United Irish
Organisation of 1798, is buried. He was the most desperate man who ever
crossed the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> path of the English Government in Ireland. "The most
extraordinary man I ever met," is the verdict of the Duke of Wellington.
"He went to France with but one hundred guineas in his pocket, and
induced Bonaparte, by his single unaided efforts, to send three
armaments to Ireland." Six and twenty miles from Dublin, the town of
<b>Newbridge</b> exists as a kind of aide-de-camp to the Commissariat
Department of the <b>Curragh Camp</b>. The Curragh, a great plain over twelve
miles square, was once a common, the property of the Geraldine tenants,
but the Crown quietly seized upon it, and "their right there is none to
dispute." It has been made a camp of instruction, and can accommodate,
under more or less permanent cover, ten thousand men. It is in a good
fox-hunting, sporting country, "the country of the short grass," and
several times a year is the scene of race meetings. It is the Newmarket
of Ireland, for here are the training stables for Punchestown,
Fairyhouse, Leopardstown, Baldoyle, and all the lesser meetings in the
Green Isle, and many of the greater ones across the water. The Curragh
was the scene of more than one battle in centuries past, and, like Tara,
was one of the historic places chosen in the minds of the insurgents of
Ninety-eight as an ideal mustering point. The Curragh District Golf Club
has been formed by the military stationed there. <b>Kildare</b>, some thirty
miles from Dublin, is the junction for the Kilkenny branch of the line.
The town is very old, being, in the early Christian era, a cell of St.
Bride, a patroness of Ireland. The ancient cathedral has been partly
rebuilt, and in the south transept is the vault of the Earls of Kildare,
progenitors of the Leinster line. These Geraldines were the most famous
of the Norman invaders:</p>

<p>The Round Tower in the graveyard, which is one hundred and three feet
high, is perfect, except that the original cap has been replaced with a
battlement, out of character with the rest. The old castle stood by, to
guard the church and tower, and what remains of it has been turned to
use as a tenement. The Earls of Kildare were often warring with the
Kings of England. The Archbishop of Cashel one time protested to the
King against the Earl burning down his cathedral, and the Earl, when
reprimanded, explained to the King in person that he would not have done
so had he not thought that the Archbishop was inside the church at the
time. This was the same Earl of whom the Parliament complained that "all
Ireland could not govern the Earl of Kildare." "Then," said the King,
"let the Earl of Kildare govern all Ireland," and he was appointed Lord
Deputy, and made an excellent one. From Kildare, Carlow, twenty-six
miles distant, and Kilkenny, fifty-one, are the principal stations on
the line which terminates at Waterford. <b>Carlow</b> is an old town which
belonged to the hereditary enemies of the Fitzgeralds, the Butlers of
Ormonde. It is beautifully situated, surrounded by fine trees, and built
on the picturesque Barrow. There is splendid water-power above the town,
and it was the first place in Ireland that was lighted with electricity.
<b>Kilkenny</b>, the marble city, easily induces the visitor to linger within
its walls and enjoy fully the attractions of the river Nore. Long ago it
was a keep of "Dermott of the Foreigners," "who had grown hoarse from
many shoutings in the battle," and was given by him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> as a dowry with
his beautiful daughter Eva to Strongbow. Afterwards it passed, by
purchase, into the possession of the Butlers, Lords of Ormonde. Here a
Parliament was held in 1367, which endeavoured by law to prevent the
absorption of the newcomers by the old Irish race. It tainted the blood
of all who gave their children into fosterage with Irish women, and
penalised the usage of Irish dress and customs. It made it a capital
offence for any of English blood to marry an Irish woman, which was
humorous enough when we remember that Strongbow, "the first of the
foreigners," did so. But the statute was of no avail, and the Butlers in
time became as big rebels as the Geraldines. Here, in 1642, the
Confederate Catholics held their Parliament. Among other things they
drafted a scheme of local government for the country, and set up the
first printing press in Ireland. <b>St. Canice's Cathedral</b>, the Round
Tower, one hundred feet high, the Black Abbey, and Franciscan Friary,
are the principal ecclesiastical objects of interest. The Round Tower is
at the southern side of the Cathedral. This latter building, which is of
an Early Pointed Style, was founded in the twelfth or thirteenth
century. The pavement is of the famous Kilkenny marble. The principal
object of interest in the building is St. Kieran's Chair, against the
wall in the northern transept.</p>

<h4>Kilkenny Castle.</h4>


<p>The grounds of the Franciscan Friary have been overbuilt by a brewery,
but the fine seven-light window and tower still stand. The <b>Black
Abbey</b>, a thirteenth century foundation, has come back into the
possession of the Order of Preachers, or Dominicans, who have restored
it. The small parish church near the northern transept of St. Canice's
contains a window commemorative of Lieutenant Hamilton, V.C., of
Inistioge, who was killed in the massacre of the Cavagnari Expedition by
the Afghans in 1879. From the market place, Kilkenny Castle, the noble
seat of the Butlers, may be entered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> In the absence of the family of
the Marquis of Ormonde, the public are allowed to visit the castle. It
is a practically modern residence, built into the ancient walls; and
three of the imposing watch towers of bygone years survive. The hall of
the castle is decorated with beautiful Spanish leather work, and the
rich tapestries on the staircase were wrought in the sixteenth century,
on looms set up in the town by Flemings. Besides the family plate,
jewels, and heirlooms&mdash;which are displayed in several apartments&mdash;the
picture gallery is exceptionally attractive. Among its treasures are
Murillo's "St. John," Corregio's "Marriage of St. Catherine," and
Giordano's "Assumption of the Blessed Virgin." From St. John's Bridge,
above the Nore, a splendid view of the castle may be seen. There is a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
pleasant pathway under the castle wall, along the river side from the
bridge. From Kilkenny many interesting excursions may be made. To
<b>Kells</b>, twelve statute miles, where there are the ruins of an important
twelfth century priory. Two miles from Kells is Kilree, where are
situate a ruined church, Round Tower, and Celtic cross, and a remarkable
tomb slab in the church, on which is an ancient symbolic sculpture of a
cock-in-a-pot crowing. Three miles from Kilree is Aghavillar, with
ruined church, attached castellated house, and Round Tower. About seven
miles from the city is the Cave of Dunmore, a stalactite cavern worth
seeing. <b>Thomastown</b>, on the line to Waterford, was formerly a walled
town. It is less than two miles from Jerpoint Abbey, the ruins of which
are interesting. It was founded by Donough Tiernach, Chief of Ossory, in
1180. The style is Early Norman, but the turrets and battlements are
fifteenth century work.</p>

<p>Cromwell, who is discredited with destroying places in Ireland where he
never was, is said to have passed by Jerpoint without molesting it, but
when the peal of bells rang out in thanksgiving, he took it for a
challenge, and returned and sacked the place. In Cork he melted down the
chapel bells, saying that "as it was a priest that invented gunpowder,
the best thing that could be done with chapel bells was to make them
into cannons," which he did.</p>

<p>If, instead of branching off the main line at Kildare, we continue along
it in the south-western direction.</p>

<p><b>Monasterevan</b>, which was an old ecclesiastical place of importance, now
insignificant except for its malting houses and distillery. The Marquis
of Drogheda's demesne and residence, Moore Abbey, stands in the centre
of the well-wooded lands, which were formerly monastic property.
<b>Portarlington</b>, a small town on the Barrow, has the seat of the Earl of
Portarlington. The river divides the town, and is the boundary here
between Kildare and the Queen's County. The Irish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> name of this place is
Coltody; but in the time of the "Merrie Monarch" it was given to a court
favourite, Lord Arlington, who here built a little harbour on the
Barrow, whence its name. In the townland of Deer Park, near the town,
there is still a colony of pure Huguenot descent. Portarlington is the
junction of the branch line running to Athlone.</p>

<p><b>Maryborough</b> is pleasantly situated on the river side. From the Rock of
Dunamaise, an old fort of "Dermot of the Foreigners" in an almost
impregnable position, there is a splendid view of the Slieve Bloom
mountain ranges. At Ballybrophy is the junction for the Parsonstown and
Roscrea and Nenagh branches. <b>Roscrea</b>, under the Devil's Bit mountains,
has celebrated ecclesiastical remains and a modern Cistercian Monastery,
the parent house of which is the famous Mount Melleray Abbey. Among the
ruins of interest to the antiquary are the remains of Augustinian and
Franciscan foundations, and a Round Tower, about the foot of which St.
Cronan had one of the early schools in Ireland in the sixth century. A
square tower of the Butlers and a tower of Prince John's Castle will
repay attention. <b>Birr Castle</b>, the seat of the Earl of Rosse at
Parsonstown, is surrounded by a fine park. It is remarkable for its
mammoth telescopes, one of which is fifty-two feet long, with a speculum
six feet in diameter. Nenagh, at the foot of the Silvermines and Keeper
mountains (2,278 feet), is a stirring market town, and possesses a
Norman keep in fair preservation. Birdhill brings us to the Shannon, the
attractions of which are dealt with in another chapter.</p>

<h4>The Bridge, Athlone.</h4>

<p>The branch line which runs from Portarlington to Athlone, runs right
through the Bog of Allen. It is available for through passengers for
Connemara. For miles, the undulating bog land, green and brown. The
<b>King's County</b> still remains out of the primeval forests, and its great
peat fields are the only source of wealth to the surrounding peasantry.
<b>Athlone</b>, some two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> miles below Lough Ree, on the Shannon, is the
military key to the Province of Connaught. The keep of the old Castle,
dating from King John's reign, remains, but the bridge and salmon weir
are of more interest. In 1691 Ginckle besieged the town on the eastern
bank, but a handful of Irish troops held the Connaught side, desiring to
keep the position until St. Ruth arrived. The defence of the bridge is
one of the most gallant exploits in Irish history. Colonel Richard
Grace, who held the position for the Jacobites, was offered security in
his estates and military honours, if he surrendered, by the Duke of
Schomberg. At night, when the offer reached the Jacobite general, he was
in his quarters, playing the familiar Irish card game of spoil-five with
his officers. The six-of-hearts happened to be the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> "deckhead." Grace
took it from the pack and wrote on the back, "It ill becomes a gentleman
to betray his trust," and gave it to the Williamite messenger. The
"six-of-hearts" is still known as "The Grace's Card," especially in
Kilkenny, where the general's estates were. From Athlone excursions may
be made to Auburn, eight miles; Clonmacnoise, ten Irish miles; and to
Lough Ree. Lissoy, where Goldsmith spent his childhood, there can be
little doubt, was the original of&mdash;</p>

<p class='center'>
"Sweet Auburn, loveliest village of the plain."
</p>

<p>It is a pleasant drive, the road from Ballykeeran skirting Lough
Killinure. Lough Ree, three miles from Athlone, is low-lying, some ten
miles long, and in parts prettily wooded. There is a small archipelago
in the northern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> end, of which pretty "Hare Island" is the residence of
Lord Castlemaine. The Seven Churches of Clonmacnoise formed the old city
of St. Kieran, whose feast day is the 9th September. There are two Round
Towers, O'Rourke's and M'Carthy's; a Holy Well, the Cairn of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> Three
Crosses, Relich Calliagh, founded by Devorgilla, who bewitched Dermot of
the Foreigners. Teampul-Kieran is a small cell. Teampul-Connor has an
interesting tenth century doorway, and in Teampul-Fineen the chancel
arch still remains, and the piscina can be traced. Teampul-Ree has two
round-headed lights and a lancet window, twelfth century work. The
<b>Great Cross of the Scriptures</b> is inscribed with Gaelic, "a prayer for
Flan, son of Malseclyn," and "a prayer for Colman, who made this cross
for St. Flan," referring to the ninth century monarch of Meath, and to
Colman, Abbot, early in the tenth century, of Clonmacnoise. The cross is
fifteen feet high, and its panels were sculptured with Scriptural
scenes, interlined with Celtic tracery.</p>

<h2>Limerick and District</h2>

<h3>LIMERICK.</h3>


<p>Leaving <b>Limerick Junction</b>, between it and Limerick City, there are few
places of interest. The country side is very rich, and is the centre of
the Creamery Co-operative system. At Boher is Glenstal, the residence of
Sir Charles Barrington. The demesne contains the Ilchester Oaks, with
which the country people associate a romance. The story is told in
detail in Lefanu's "Seventy Years of Irish Life." At Caghercullen, which
is now part of Glenstal Demesne, early in the last century lived Squire
O'Grady, an old <i>grandee</i> of Limerick; he was a fox-hunting widower, and
his beautiful and only daughter was the cynosure of all eyes. When she
came out at a Limerick hunt ball the little beauty captivated Lord
Stourdale&mdash;eldest son to Lord Ilchester who was then with his regiment
at Limerick. O'Grady's keen eye soon discerned that the young people
were falling in love with each other. Proud of his family as the
Irishman was, he feared his position was such that an English lord may
not look on an alliance with favour. He wrote a friendly letter to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> Lord
Ilchester&mdash;in order to prevent trouble&mdash;saying that, as an elder man, he
perceived that his son was about getting into a scrape, and it would be
well to have him brought home or sent on active service. Stourdale
disappeared; and Lord Ilchester wrote thanking the squire, and notifying
that an old military friend&mdash;a Colonel Prendergast&mdash;would call and thank
him personally. The colonel came in good time, and partook of O'Grady's
hospitality. As he was leaving, he mentioned to the squire that he
thought his beautiful daughter was falling into bad health. O'Grady,
with brusque confidence, said that she had been fooling about Stourdale,
but would soon forget him. Lovers will rejoice at the sequel of the
romance. Colonel Prendergast discovered himself as Lord Ilchester, and
expressed his gratification at the possibility of having such a wife for
his son. There was the usual happy marriage; and the present Earl of
Ilchester and the present Earl of Lansdowne, can claim descent from
Maureen O'Grady.</p>

<p><b>Limerick</b>.&mdash;Like most of the Munster seaboard towns, it was built by
the Danes; and it was the cock-pit of the fights between the Ostmen and
the warlike clans who followed O'Brien's banner in the early centuries.
It made history in Cromwell's days, and until recently the old house
occupied by Ireton stood within its streets. Ireton sentenced many men
of eminence to death during the short triumph of Cromwell. Among the
most noble of the cavaliers who died at Limerick was Geoffrey Barron of
Clonmel, a young Irish lawyer who acted as civil secretary to the
Confederates. With exquisite cruelty he was sentenced to be executed
upon the morning which had previously been fixed for his wedding. He
asked, as a favour, that he should be permitted to wear his bridegroom
attire on the scaffold, and Ireton granted the boon.</p>

<p>He made a brave show amid the crop-eared Roundheads.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Now, Geoffrey Barron must die."</span><br />
</p>

<p>But the name of Limerick scintillates in those glowing chapters in its
country's history, when it stoutly withstood the valour and prowess of
the great soldier-king, William of Orange. Sarsfield, Earl of Lucan, the
beloved of damsels and dames, was the hero of this period. A handsome,
large-limbed, brawny soldier, towering over the tallest of his dragoons,
and true as the steel he wore, he was a fitting leader of a forlorn
hope. Originally, one of the "Gentlemen of the Guard" under the Merrie
Monarch, his defence of Limerick was a military achievement worthy of
the ambition of any general; nor were his Williamite opponents slow to
cordially appreciate his valour. But he was fated to die, "on a far,
foreign field." The sieges of Limerick led up to its name of the City of
the Broken Treaty. William of Nassau, having routed King James in
August, 1690, invested the city with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> 35,000 men. Tyrconnel and Lauzun,
Commander of the French allies, had cleared out, considering that the
place could not be defended. Sarsfield, although not in command, with
other kindred spirits, decided to defend the position. The heavy
ordnance of the Williamites, while on the way to the scene of siege, was
surprised at night at Ballyneety by Sarsfield and a hero called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
"Galloping O'Hogan," and the guns spiked and the ammunition mined and
fired. Auxiliary artillery was, however, brought into camp, and the
assault delivered. The guns breached the walls, the outworks were
carried, but before the garrison could pour in, the townspeople&mdash;men and
women&mdash;the latter, vieing in valour, flowed out and swept away all
opposition. The siege was raised. But a year later, Ginckle again
invested the place by land and sea. After three months' defence,
Sarsfield agreed to capitulate, the chief conditions of the treaty
being, that Catholics should be admitted to practice their religion
without hindrance, and that the Jacobite garrison should march out with
the honours of war. The latter condition was kept, but when Sarsfield
and his regiments had gone beyond the seas, the former was shamefully
violated. By the Thomond may be seen the Treaty Stone, on which the
capitulation papers were signed, October 3rd, 1691. In the Cathedral
place is the modern monument to Sarsfield. The castle, which was built
by King John&mdash;now a store&mdash;is an excellent example of the military
architecture introduced into Ireland by the Normans. The Shannon, the
largest river in Ireland, flows through the city. Limerick lace is
valued wherever people of taste are. The industry still thrives; but the
former greatness of the glove manufacturers has departed. Bacon curing
is the great industry of the city to-day, and the names of Denny,
Matterson, and Shaw&mdash;the principal manufacturers&mdash;have become household
words. The greatest factory in Limerick, however, is belonging to the
famous Condensed Milk Company, organized through the enterprise of Sir
Thomas Cleeve. The milk of some 15,000 cows contributes to the huge
output of this great concern.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>From Limerick tours may be made into North Kerry by rail, or by combined
steamer and coach service along the Shannon lakes and shores. The
amalgamation of the railway services in the south and west of Ireland
has contributed greatly to the many facilities which, with an improved
railway accommodation, now await the tourist.</p>

<h4>Falls of Doonass-River Shannon.</h4>


<p>Some seven miles from Limerick, and about the same distance from
Killaloe, is the pretty little town of <b>Castleconnell</b>. The place was of
yore a stronghold of the O'Brien's, and to-day the remains of the old
castle from which the village takes the name still stand. During the
Jacobite wars the place was of importance as one of the military keys to
the Province of Connaught, and Sarsfield and Ginkel alternately
garrisoned and fought for its possession. The village is situated
delightfully beside "The lordly Shannon," and is famous as a resort for
anglers. The scenery in the immediate vicinity is unsurpassed, and the
Shannon here has been described as possessing "The majesty of the Amazon
with the grandeur of the Rhine." Taking the well-appointed Shannon Hotel
as our centre many most enjoyable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> excursions can be made to the
beautiful places in the adjoining district. The hotel itself is only
five minutes' walk from the far-famed Rapids of Doonass, and beside the
celebrated Chalybeate Spa. Beneath a list of excursions is given of some
of the pleasant driving and boating trips that may be made. It cannot
pretend to be exhaustive, however, and is only offered as suggestive.
Assume that the visitor has three days at his disposal&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Above a bend in the river at the Falls of Doonass the "Rapids" begin,
and eddying and whirling through the rocks run for nearly half a mile
along the surface of the river. It is to the angler, however,
Castleconnell will prove most attractive. The season commences on the
1st February, and closes on the 31st October. Trout, pike, and perch
fishing free; salmon and grilse fishing by arrangement. The fishing-rods
manufactured at Castleconnell have won a world-wide reputation for
Messrs. Enright and Sons, and Mr. Jack Enright has himself won the
record as a long distance fly caster. A writer in <i>The Fishing Gazette</i>
having dealt in an appreciative article with Castleconnell gives
valuable information as to the names and situations of the more
important pools on the river.</p>

<p>The fisheries in the Castleconnell district taken in rotation from
below, are: the Prospect or Clareville Fishery, on the Limerick side of
the river (this means that the fishery extends to midstream; adjoining
it on the Clare side, and immediately opposite, is the Landscape
Fishery. Both of these are well-known salmon and peel catches. A few of
the best pools in Prospect are Pinnee, Salahoughe, Feemoor, and
Commogue. On Landscape the best pools are Poulahoo, Pallaherro, and
Filebegs).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>Adjoining the Prospect Fishery, on the Limerick side of the river, is
the New Garden Fishery, which contains the pools of Moreagh, Glassogue,
Black Weir, and Sporting Eddy. Next to this, on the Limerick side, is
the Hermitage Fishery, which contains some famous catches, such as Back
of Leap, Fallahassa, Poolbeg, the Commodore, Bunnymoor, and Head of
Moreagh. Still on the Limerick side, we next reach the Woodland's
Fishery, a picturesque portion of the Shannon, and here are the pools of
Panlaides, Drarhus, Thunnavullion, and Long Eddy. Next is reached the
Castle Fishery, and the pools here are Balcraheen, Lackaleen, and the
Lough, the last affording several courses of fly fishing. Still on the
Limerick side the World's End Fishery adjoins the Castle Fishery, and
the pools here are the Pantry, the Kitchen, and the Over the Weir.</p>

<p>Returning to the Clare side of the river the fishery next to Landscape
is the famous Doonas, the lower part of which contains the pools of
Poolcoom, the Stand, Black Weir, Faalgorribs, Franklin's Eddy, and the
Old Door, while the upper part includes Lickenish, the Dancing Hole, Old
Turf, Lurgah, Lacka, and Sallybush. Next on the Clare side we reach the
Summer Hill Fishery, part of which is opposite the Woodland's Fishery
and part opposite the Castle Fishery. The pools on Summer Hill are the
Black Eddy, Clare side of Drarhus, Thunahancha, Figar, Clare side of
Lackaleen, and Clare side of the Lough. After this the Erinagh Fishery
is reached, and here the pools are Gorribs and side of the big Eddy.</p>

<p>In the spring salmon fishing is pursued principally with Devon minnows
as lures, the "cullough" running a good second favourite. Phantom
minnows and the very large spinning Shannon flies are also useful. A bit
later on the prawn takes precedence, the bigger the prawn the better. As
the season advances the lure, whatever it may be&mdash;fly, minnow, prawn, or
what not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>&mdash;should decrease in size until October, when again they should
assume larger proportions, but not so big as in the spring. Towards the
latter end of March, and onwards for the rest of the season, artificial
flies are are almost exclusively used. Truly wonderful specimens of the
fly dresser's art are some of the Shannon patterns. Fancy a salmon fly
dressed on an 8-o hook! Yet this is at times absolutely necessary to
ensure success. The best patterns for various times of the year are&mdash;For
February, March, and April, big Shannon Blue Fly, the Black Goldfinch,
the Jock Scot, and the Yellow Lahobber; for May, June, and July, Purple
Mixture, tinsel bodied Green Parrot, purple bodied Green Parrot, Silver
and Blue Doctors, Purple Widgeon, Orange and Grouse, and Thunder and
Lightning. Towards the end of the season here, as elsewhere, strange
fancy patterns will frequently prove successful. The most suitable
patterns of trout flies (the size of which depends entirely upon the

<p>At the foot of Lough Derg stands <b>Killaloe</b>, an ideal resting place for
an angler. The cathedral is of some interest, and in the vicinity the
Protestant Bishop's palace stands. The bridge connecting the town with
the village of Ballina has thirteen arches, and the huge weir helps as a
breakwater. Shortly above the bridge of old time stood Kincora, the
fortified palace of Brian Boru; its glory has departed, and all that
remains is a mound, crowned with a grove of trees. Here Brian of the
Tribes held his sway; and still the peasant in Munster, wishing to
express his welcome, says in Gaelic&mdash;"Were mine the boire of the Dane or
the wine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> of Kincora, it would be poured for you." Here it was that the
Norse King, Magnus, wintered early in the twelfth century, and found a
wife for his son, Sigurd, in the house of Brian. M'Laig, the bard of
Brian Boru, after the death of his king in 1014, made a lamentation,
which Mangan thus translated:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Oh! where Kincora is Brian the Great?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And where is the beauty that once was thine?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Oh! where are the princes and nobles that sate</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">At the feast in thy halls, and drank the red wine?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Where! oh, Kincora.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">They are gone, those heroes of royal birth,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Who plundered no church and broke no trust,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">It is weary for me to be living on earth,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When they, oh, Kincora, are below in the dust.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Lo, of Kincora."</span><br />

<p>From Killaloe, northwards for twenty-five miles, Lough Derg at times
expands in width over eight miles, where its distant shores form a sky
line&mdash;hedged in with Tipperary and Clare Mountains. The lough loses none
of its picturesque attractiveness to the sportsman, who is informed that
the whole of the fishing is free.</p>

<p>From Limerick as centre, as we have said, tours may be made into North
Kerry.</p>

<p>To the average tourist North Kerry is a <i>terra incognita</i>, and yet from
the pleasant pasture lands around "Sweet Adare" in Limerick to where the
distant mountain of Caherconree sees his regal head reflected in the
sea&mdash;there lies a beautiful land. Beyond Patrickswell, on the Maigue, is
the little village of Adare, once the camping ground and stronghold of
"those very great scorners of death," the Desmond Geraldines. Still the
ruins of Desmond Castle, and of three abbeys, tell the tale that here
once, beside a citadel of strength, were places of religion and refuge.
Now, in the depth of the retreat of sylvan splendour, the Earl of
Dunraven has his noble mansion.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> At Adare, as well as at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> Ballingrane,
six miles away, still are many evidences of the Palatine plantations,
which were effected here in the eighteenth century. In 1709 a fleet was
sent to Rotterdam by Queen Anne, and brought to England some 7,000
refugees from the German Palatinate. Of these, over 3,000 were settled
in this part of the County Limerick. They were allowed eight acres of
land for each man, woman, and child, at <i>5s.</i> per acre; and the
Government engaged to pay their rent for twenty years, and supplied
every man with a musket to protect himself. Industrious and frugal, the
exiles throve in the land of their adoption; many of them emigrated to
America, and only a comparatively small number of families still remain.
These, however, preserve, besides the names, many of the characteristics
of their predecessors<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>&mdash;as Dr. R. T. Mitchell, Inspector of
Registration in Ireland, testifies in his survey of this very
district:&mdash;"Differing originally in language, though even the oldest of
the present generation know nothing of the German tongue spoken or
written, as well as in race and religion, from the natives amongst whom
they were planted, these Palatines still cling together like the members
of a clan, and worship together. Most of them have a distinctly foreign
type of features, and are strongly built, swarthy in complexion, dark
haired, and brown eyed. The comfortable houses built in 1709 are in
ruins now. The original square of Court Matrix in the ruined wall can be
traced, and also, in the very centre of this square the foundations of
the little Meeting House in which John Wesley occasionally preached to
them in the interval, 1750-1765. Modern houses stand there now, but not
closely grouped together. They are all comfortable in appearance, some
thatched, some slated, some with one story, others with two; nearly all
have a neat little flower garden in front, and very many have an orchard
beside or immediately behind the house. There is all the appearance of
thrift and industry among them." From <b>Ballingrane</b>, a branch line
passing Askeaton, with its ruined Castle and Abbey ruins, to <b>Foynes</b>, a
good harbour, from which passage can be made to Kilrush, and thence per
rail to Kilkee. From the junction the main line runs by <b>Rathkeale</b> and
<b>Newcastle</b>, where there is a ruined castle of the Knights Templars, and
by Abbeyfeale and Kilmorna, where Mr. Pierce Mahony bred and kept his
stud of famous Kerry cattle, to Listowel, an old market town which
figured in the Desmond rebellion.</p>

<p>From Listowel the Lartigue railway, unique in the British Isles, runs to
<b>Ballybunion</b>, a beautiful watering place, remarkable for its sea-caves
and old castle. <b>Ardfert</b> is remarkable for its ruined Abbey and
Cathedral, both dedicated to St. Brendon, the story of whose voyage to
the New World was one of the subjects<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> mentioned at the court of
Ferdinand and Isabella by Columbus, when inducing them to assist him in
his mission of discovery. <b>Tralee</b> is the largest town in the Kingdom of
Kerry. It is one of the most thriving towns in the south of Ireland, and
is situated in the vicinity of marine and mountain scenery. Those
interested in the revival of industry in Ireland will do well to visit
the Kerry Knitting Co.'s Factory, as well as the fine bacon-curing
establishment of the Wholesale Co-operative Society which has been
erected under the management of the well known Mr. Joseph Prosser. At
Spa and Fenit there is good sea-bathing, and on the Dingle Promontory
the ascent of Mount Brandon may be made. From Dingle excursions can
easily be taken to Slea Head, by Ventry, and under the Eagles' Mountain,
and within sight of the Blasket Islands. <b>Smerwick</b> has in its
neighbourhood a coast line of mighty cliffs, the most remarkable of
which is called the <b>Three Sisters</b>. Smerwick was the scene of the
massacre of seven hundred Spaniards, who had surrendered in the
sixteenth century to Lord Deputy Grey's forces. The bloody affair is the
blackest stain in the careers of the gallant Raleigh and the gentle
Spenser. Between Smerwick and Ballydavid Head the well preserved remains
of the <b>Oratory of Gallerius</b> may be seen.</p>

<h2>The Shannon Lakes.</h2>

<h3>DUKE OF YORK ROUTE.</h3>


<p>The Shannon Development Company run during the season a service of
steamers between Killaloe and Dromod (county Leitrim). The whole of the
journey from <b>Killaloe</b> to Dromod&mdash;about one hundred miles&mdash;is
interesting and full of variety, the shores and lakes of the lordly
river presenting an ever-changing panorama of beautiful scenes. About
Killaloe the views are very fine. The mountains of Clare and Tipperary
shadow the town on either side, and away to the north for twenty-three
miles stretches Lough Derg. Going up the lake, the first stopping place
is at Scariff, which overlooks the beautiful Inniscattery or Holy
Island. The reach from here to Portumna is crowded with islands, and on
both shores are ruined castles and finely wooded demesnes. Dromineer, on
the opposite bank, four and a quarter miles from Nenagh, is the next
station. Nearly opposite Portumna, with its ruined and blackened castle,
are the ruins of the monastery of Tirdaglass.</p>

Galway, along which the river winds tranquilly, passing beautifully
wooded islands; its banks green with rich, low-lying pastures. A few
miles from Shannon Bridge is Clonmacnoise, over which hang many ancient
memories of learning, of wars, and of worship. Near Athlone is a point
in the river where the Counties of Westmeath, Roscommon, and King's
County meet, and the waters of Lough Ree wash the shores of County
Roscommon on the one side and of Westmeath and Longford on the other.
Lough Ree is but little known to the tourist; and yet this lake, with
its rocky shores full of indentations, and its shoals of sparkling
islands, is one of the loveliest in Ireland. King John's Castle, on the
Roscommon side of the lake, is a magnificent Norman ruin, and the town
of Roscommon&mdash;which is not far from the brink of the lake&mdash;also contains
the remains of a fine castle and of a Dominican Friary. The castle,
which is flanked by four towers of massive masonry, was built in the
thirteenth century by Sir Robert de Ufford, and afterwards suffered many
changes of fortune; it is now the property of The O'Conor Don. The abbey
is chiefly interesting as containing the sculptured tomb of Phelim
Cathal O'Connor.</p>

<p>Enshrined in song and <i>saga</i>, set in the beautiful valley of a romantic
river, Cork is one of the pleasantest places within the four shores of
"the most distressful country." It is the capital of the rich Province
of Munster, "the wheat of Ireland," says a Gaelic proverb, and while it
preserves the characteristics of an old Irish town, here, too, the
traveller, familiar with the quaint cities of the Continent, will meet
with much that is suggestive of foreign scenes.</p>

<p><br /></p>


<p>Cork sits snugly at the foot of, and leans her back up against, high
hills that shelter her from the north, and the breeze that blows up from
the sea is fresh and mildly bracing. From a height to the north
overlooking the city a bird's-eye view can be had of the entire
surroundings, and of what the poet Spenser called&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"The pleasant Lee, that like an island fayre</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Encloseth Cork in his divided flood."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Away to the west the eye can easily trace the river, winding with haste
to the sea, through the barony of Muskerry, "the fair country," from its
fountain home over the hills and far away.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<h4>Patrick-street, Cork.</h4>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>More than halfway along the Mardyke Walk there is a sidepath leading
down to a ferry across the Lee. Here a good view may be had of the river
looking towards the city, with Sunday's Well, Blair's Castle, and
Shandon standing high on the hill.</p>

<p>The history of the foundation of Cork City, and its progress through the
centuries, is well authenticated. Towards the close of the sixth
century, the place was founded by Lochan, son of Amirgin, the great
smith to Tiernach M'Hugh, the proud chief of the O'Mahonys. Lochan has
since come to be called St. Finbarr. His feast day is a retrenched
holiday in the diocese of Cork, and his patron day is kept by the
peasantry at the shrine of Gougane Barra, by the cradle of the river
Lee. The Irish name, Cork, signifies that the locality was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> marsh, and
in the life of its founder it is described as a "land of many waters."</p>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/img075.jpg" alt="The Marina" title="The Marina" /></div>

<p class='center'><i>Photo&mdash;Roche, Dublin.</i></p>

<h4>The Marina, Cork.</h4>


<p>For less than three hundred years the little city throve, and then came
the Sea Rovers, hungry for spoil. In 820 they burned down Cork, carrying
away as pillage the silver coffin wherein St. Finbarr was buried.
Shortly afterwards they returned, and seized on the marshes lying
beneath Gill Abbey Rock, fortified them, and founded another little
city&mdash;but their own. There they sang their "Mass of the Lances; it began
at the rising of the sun," and, as the Four Masters assure us,
"wheresoever they marched they were escorted by fire."</p>

<p>But in time the Rovers were absorbed, and race hatreds died out. They
paid tribute to the MacCarthys, and were married and given in marriage
to the Irish. Merovingian Kings came to buy and sell in Cork, and the
Sagas of the North tell of many a hardy Norseman who fell captive to the
maidens of Munster. To this day the Danish blood moulds the nature of
many in Cork, and among the men especially the passionate affection for
the sea is a characteristic. When the Normans invaded Ireland they found
Cork a Danish fortress. They broke the power of the Danes in a sea
fight, and won over the allegiance of MacCarthy, the old King of Cork,
through the wiles of a woman. The strangers had not been long in the
city when they, like the Danes before them, were absorbed, and became
more Irish than the Irish themselves. As their island city grew in
opulence, they began to assert an independence similar to the free
cities of the Continent. A historical writer of repute points out that
they were practically independent of external authority. Their edicts
had nearly the force of laws. They levied taxes, and regulated commerce.
They judged, pilloried, and hanged offenders. To suit themselves they
modified the English laws of property. They set up a mint of their own,
and their money had to be declared by the English Parliament to be
"utterly damned."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>Their audacity can be imagined from the part they played in Perkin
Warbeck's rebellion of 1492. They decked him out "with some clothes of
silk," and John Walters, the Mayor, insisting that the poor Fleming was
son to the Duke of Clarence, demanded that the Lord Deputy should
declare him King. Failing in this a number of Cork merchants sent him to
France, where they duped the King, and induced the Duchess of Burgundy
to give them armament and money. They then sailed for Kent, and having
landed there, proclaimed their foundling "Richard the Fourth, King of
England and Lord of Ireland." But the sequel of all this bravura
behaviour was not so happy, as Warbeck and Walters lost their heads, and
Cork lost its charter.</p>

<p>In 1847 the city suffered fearfully from the ravages of famine and
famine fever. The failure of the potato crop drove the unfortunate,
hunger-stricken peasantry into the city for sustenance; and it has been
estimated that upwards of a million of people emigrated in these unhappy
years through the port of Cork. During the Fenian movement, 1865-67,
Cork was a hotbed of treason, and more prisoners were sentenced from
there than from all the other parts of Ireland put together. Thus, in
the nineteenth century, the name of "Rebel Cork," which was earned so
far back as the time of Perkin Warbeck, was still deserved.</p>

<p>The manners of the people, gentle and simple, rich and poor, are
perfect. There is, perhaps, too often a tendency to adopt your view of
anything or everything with the most accommodating agreeableness. This
is very pleasant, if not always sincere, but in this respect a thing
never to be forgotten is that Cork is only a few miles from Blarney, and</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"There is a stone there, whoever kisses,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Oh! he never misses to grow eloquent.</span><br />

<p>Thackeray, like many another man before his time and since, has paid
tribute to the loveliness of the girls of Cork. There is a graceful
charm about them before which the most inveterate bachelor succumbs. The
accents of the Siren singers were never so insinuating and caressing as
the Munster brogue as it slips off the tongue of a gentlewoman. Blue
eyes predominate, but are excelled in lustre by what Froude has been
pleased to call "the cold grey eyes of the dark Celt of the south of
Ireland." Edmund Spencer, when he was not busy "undertaking" Rapparees,
or smoking Raleigh's fragrant weed&mdash;"than which there is no more fair
herb under the broad canopy of heaven"&mdash;wooed and won and wedded a fair
woman of Cork; not of the city, though, but of the county. She was a
country lass, as he is at pains to point out to the Shandon belles who
fain would vie with her:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Tell me, ye merchant daughters, did ye see</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So fayre a creature in your town before?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Her goodlie eyes, like sapphyres shining bright;</span><br />

<p>There is nothing of peculiar interest about the streets of Cork but
their number, their narrowness, and the irregularity of the houses. St.
Patrick's-street, which is the principal thoroughfare, has many handsome
shops, and winds its way in three curves through the city.</p>

<p>From the "Dyke," as it is locally known, through the "Band Field"&mdash;the
baby park of Cork&mdash;we can cross to an entrance to the Queen's College on
the Western-road. The College itself is a handsome building of white
Cork limestone, in the later Tudor style, forming three sides of a
quadrangle, and consisting of lecture-rooms, museum, examination hall,
&amp;c. It is built in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> the centre of well-laid pleasure grounds, which are
open to the public, and which formerly were the site of St. Finbarr's
old monastery. During the session proper, practically from November to
June, visitors will not be admitted through the building without an
official order, which may be had at the Registrar's office.</p>

<p>During the vacation the steward or assistant officials are in attendance
to conduct visitors. The large palm-house is one of the most successful
in Ireland, and the Crawford Observatory will repay a visit. The grounds
were laid out under the personal supervision of the late president, Dr.
W. K. Sullivan, a distinguished scientist. While at the south side of
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> city, St. Finbarr's Cathedral<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> (Church of Ireland), eastward from
the College, should be seen. It is a very dignified design of the French
Early Pointed style. The nave, aisles, and transepts are grouped under
three lofty towers with spires.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>From the foot of the street a few minutes' walk will bring us under the
old bi-coloured steeple, which contains the famous Shandon Bells. The
church was built in 1772. The steeple is unique, inasmuch as the
southern and western sides are of white limestone, and the northern and
eastern red sandstone&mdash;</p>

</p>

<p>But the "Bells" are the chief attraction, and the quaint inscriptions on
them amuse the curious. In the stillness of a summer night their sweet
chimes sound with peculiar cadence across the waters which encircle the
old city of the Lee. The charter song of Cork is:&mdash;</p>

<p>

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With deep affection and recollection</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Fling round my cradle their magic spells;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">On this I ponder, where'er I wander,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And thus grow fonder, sweet Cork, of thee;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">With thy bells of Shandon,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">That sound so grand on</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">The pleasant waters of the river Lee.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I have heard bells chiming full many a clime in,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Tolling sublime in cathedral shrine;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">While at a glib rate brass tongues would vibrate,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">But all their music spoke nought to thine;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For memory dwelling on each proud swelling</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Of thy belfry knelling its bold notes free,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Made the bells of Shandon</span><br />

<h4>Shandon Church, Cork.</h4>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>Francis Sylvester Mahony, author of this ballad, known in the world of
literature as "Father Prout," was born in Cork in 1804. He was educated
for the priesthood, but spent the best years of his life in London, as a
magazine writer.</p>

<p>Further north than Shandon is St. Mary's Roman Catholic Cathedral, an
ample piece of architecture, not particularly attractive. Coming down
the hill towards the city on Pope's-quay, St. Mary's Dominican Church
may be seen. It is a very beautiful church, of the composite style of
architecture. The Grecian portico is remarkable for the gracefulness and
justness of its proportions, and is very much admired. It is, perhaps,
the most chaste building of its kind in the kingdom.</p>

<p>Besides the churches and public buildings already enumerated, the
Courthouse and the Municipal Schools of Science and Art should be seen.
The Courthouse is in Great George-street. In a recent fire there many
valuable records were destroyed. Courthouses seem to be ill-fated in
Cork. The old Courthouse fell during the trial for treason in the Penal
days of the Catholic Bishop of Cork. The present Courthouse was burnt on
Good Friday, 1891.</p>

<p>The punning, duel-fighting, hanging judge, Lord Norbury, of whom the
country people still say, "He'd hang a man as soon as knock the head off
a rush," often dispensed with an escort in the most exciting times, and
rode here on circuit with a brace of pistols at his saddle-bow. But he
was a man of uncommon determination. Once, when his acts were unusually
unjudicial, he was reprimanded from Dublin Castle and threatened with
compulsory retirement. He rode instanter to Dublin, and never stopped
until he drew rein at the Castle gate. He demanded to see the Lord
Lieutenant, but the then Viceroy, Lord Talbot, was in England. He was
ushered into the presence of a courteous official, who was a little
astonished to be authoritatively asked, "Who are you?" "I, sir," said
the Under Secretary,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> whom he addressed, "am Mr. Gregory." "Then you be
d&mdash;&mdash;d, and don't Sir me," said his Lordship. "Fifty-two years ago I
began life at the Irish Bar with fifty guineas and a case of pistols.
Here it is! I have fought my way to preferment. Within a few months I
expect a letter of an unpleasant character from the Castle. Tell the
writer he may take his choice of these, and send me his second." History
does not record whether "the letter of an unpleasant character" was ever
written.</p>

<h4>Cork Exhibition.</h4>


<p>The Municipal Buildings of Science and Art in Emmet-place can bear
comparison with those of any town of the same size in Great Britain or
Ireland. The sculpture and picture galleries are open to visitors. The
splendid collection of casts from the antiques in the Vatican Gallery
were executed under the superintendence of Canova, and sent by Pope Pius
VII. to George IV. The ship which carried them by long sea from Italy
put into Cork, and was there detained for harbour dues. The King,
instead of paying, transferred the Papal gift to the Cork Society of
Arts.</p>

<p>A paltry exhibit of coins, antiquities, and fossils forms the Museum.
Although Cork County has been one of the richest in Ireland in "finds"
of gold and metal work of the ancient Irish, they are absolutely
unrepresented.</p>


<h3>CORK DISTRICT.</h3>

<p>The county of Cork is the largest shire in Ireland. The pleasure seeker,
the artist, the antiquary, the sportsman, the invalid, will each find
within its broad barriers much to meet his wants. Sir Walter Scott is
credited with the statement that the history of this single county
contains more romance than the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> history of the lowlands and highlands of
his own dear land of the mountain and the flood.</p>

<p>The surface of the county Cork is as diversified as the people. In some
places, such as Kilworth, Mushera, and Ballyhoura, the elevation is
considerable, elsewhere it sinks to a low-lying plain, such as at
Kilcrea, where the bog is that tradition says saw the last wolf in
Ireland killed, and Imokilly, where the sea is yearly eating into the
lowlands. The county is watered by no less than twenty rivers of
importance.</p>

<p>Making the city the headquarters for a few days, there are many places
of interest in the vicinity which may with ease be visited. The
excellent tram system may be availed of by visitors to the sights in its
immediate vicinity. A drive by Douglas and Vernamount can be
recommended. Douglas was an old town, famous for its manufacture of sail
cloth, and in recent years a village providence in the person of the
late Mr. John Morrogh has resuscitated industry in the district by the
establishment of a splendidly equipped tweed factory. With a fine day
and a good "outside jaunting-car" to travel the five miles' drive to
<b>Blarney Castle</b> will be found most enjoyable. The famous stone, which
no one should miss kissing, is set in the parapet wall. The word
"Blarney," meaning pleasant "deluderin' talk," is said to have
originated at the Court of Queen Elizabeth. MacCarthy, the then
chieftain over the clan of that name, resided at Blarney, and was
repeatedly asked to come in from "off his keeping," as the phrase in the
State Papers goes, to abjure the system of Tanistry by which the clan
elected the chief, and take tenure of his lands direct from the Crown.
He was always promising with fair words and soft speech to do what was
desired, but never could be got to come to the sticking point. The
Queen, it is told, when one of his speeches was brought to her, said,
"This is all Blarney; what he says he never means."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>By the Great Southern and Western Railway the castle can also be
reached. By this route a good stretch of the Upper Lee is seen, with
Carrigrohane Castle, which belonged to the M'Sweeneys, beetling high on
a rock, and the line runs through the picturesque valley of the
Sournagh, which may be likened to a Swiss ravine. All the remains of the
former greatness of Blarney consists of the ruins of two mansions, one
of the fifteenth century, and the other of the Elizabethan period. In
its time the place was one of considerable strength, and was erected by
Cormac MacCarthy Laider, or the Strong-handed chief of his name. Most of
the outworks and defences are gone. The old square keep, ivy-crowned,
rises from a huge limestone rock, around which the Coomaun or crooked
river winds. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> Castle is over 120 feet high; the great staircase at
the right-hand side leads through the entire building, here and there
small vaulted chambers being set in the massive walls, which are in
places nine feet thick. The arched room, of which the projecting window
with three lights overlooks the streamlet below, is known as the Earl's
Chamber. The last fight in which Blarney Castle figured, was that in
which the Confederates held out for King Charles in 1642. It fell before
the superior ordnance of Cromwell's commander, Ireton. It was never
afterwards used for a dwelling-house, being almost completely
dismantled. From the summit of the Castle a good view of the surrounding
country can be had. To the west lies Muskerry, with what Ruskin calls
"the would-be hills" rising towards Mushera Mountain. To the north is
St. Ann's Hydropathic Establishment, on a gentle slope, surrounded by
well-wooded parks. In the village beneath is the well-known Blarney
Tweed Factory of Messrs. Martin Mahony Brothers, through which visitors
may be shown when convenient to the courteous proprietors. The "Rock
Close," which is at the foot of the Castle at the southern side, is one
beautiful jungle of foliage, in which myrtle, ivy, and arbutus
intertwine with the rowan tree and the silver hazel.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/img087.jpg" alt="Blarney Castle" title="Blarney Castle" /></div>

<h4>Blarney Castle.</h4>


<p>If we have gone to Blarney on the "outside jaunting-car," the return
journey may be made by Bawnafinny, Kerry Pike, and the Sournagh Valley,
and Northern Lee road. Beneath Bawnafinny, "the pastures of beauty," we
get a glimpse of Blarney Lake, a broad sheet of water bordered with tall
trees, above which the old Castle raises its head. It would gladden the
heart of Izaak Walton, as it is full of fish, among which is the famous
gillaroo trout, which will not rise to the tantalising fly. The
peasantry have a legend, that within the lake lies hidden the treasure
and plate of the last of the MacCarthys, who hid them there sooner than
allow his conquerors to gain possession of it. The secret is said to be
known to three of the old family, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> before one dies he tells it to
the other, so that it may be recovered when the MacCarthy "comes to his
own again." The milk girls also on May mornings are said to have
frequently seen fairy cows along the banks of the lake, which vanish
into thin mists when approached by human footsteps!</p>


<p><br /></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/img089.jpg" alt="Blackrock Castle" title="Blackrock Castle" /></div>

<p class='center'><i>Photo&mdash;Roche, Dublin.</i></p>

<h4>Blackrock Castle, Cork.</h4>


<p><b>Ballincollig</b> is a place of some interest. The powder mill is a
long-established factory, and gives considerable employment in the
neighbourhood. The large cavalry barracks is amongst the finest in the
south of Ireland.</p>

<p><b>Blackrock</b> is little better than a fishing village; but the suburbs
between it and Cork are filled with villa residences, pleasure grounds,
and market gardens.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> Beside the road, between the city and the village,
are situated the well-known nursery gardens belong to Hartland. The
daffodil farm, when the flowers are full, is a sight very difficult to
surpass in the three Kingdoms. Maxwellstown House, on the slope of a
southern hill, was the scene of a tragedy, not yet forgotten in Cork.
After a marriage <i>dejeuner</i>, the bride retired to her dressing-room to
don her going-away dress, but the bridegroom waited in vain for her
return. She had died suddenly in the arms of those who attended her; and
the story goes that the disconsolate lover dismissed the servants, shut
up the house with everything just as it was, and went on his way out
into the wide world alone. Long years afterwards, when news of his death
came from a far-off land, his next-of-kin had the house re-opened, and
found everything just as it had been left half a century before, after
the wedding breakfast. The dust and cobwebs were cleared away, and all
went to the hammer.</p>

<p>Eastward, towards the harbour's mouth, there is much to be enjoyed.
Excursionists may take the train direct from the Great Southern and
Western Railway terminus, or by Passage from the Albert Station, and
then by steamer to Queenstown. Taking the direct line the train runs
almost parallel with the promenade called the Marina, which separates
from the river side the broad pasture known as Cork Park, which is the
local race course. A race meeting at Cork is well worth witnessing. The
gay young bucks, described long ago by Arthur Young, still are with us,
and they and their lady friends make a fine flutter during race week.</p>

<h4>Queenstown Harbour.</h4>


<p><b>Passage</b> (<b>West</b>) was once the busy site of ship-building and
dock-yards, but the industry is no longer of anything like its original
proportions. The town is an old-fashioned place, and has not escaped the
pen of Father Prout, who, in what he calls "manifestly an imitation of
that unrivalled dithyramb," The Groves of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> Blarney&mdash;with little of its
humours and all its absurdity&mdash;signs the attractions of what he styles a
fashionable Irish watering-place:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"The town of Passage</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Is both large and spacious,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And situate</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Upon the say;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Tis nate and dacent,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And quite adjacent</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To come from Cork</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">On a summer's day."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Steamers ply between the railway station at Passage and the many little
towns around the port. <b>Glenbrook</b> and <b>Monkstown</b> are particularly
picturesque. Above the latter, nestling in the trees, may be seen
Monkstown Castle, the legend attached to which says it was built for one
groat. The owner of the site, one of the Archdeckens, an Anglo-Irish
family, having gone away to the wars in the Lowlands, his better-half
promised him a pleasant surprise on his return. She employed a number of
workmen to build the castle, a condition of the contract being that they
should buy their food from her while so engaged. Truly, she was a shrewd
woman. Her profits were such, that she had enough to pay the entire cost
of the work, less one solitary groat.</p>

<p><b>Spike Island</b> is mentioned in Church History as a present given by a
Munster King to St. Cartach, of Lismore. In modern times it was used as
a convict prison, the convicts' labour being employed in the
construction of the fortifications around the harbour.</p>

<p><b>Queenstown</b>, or, to give it its old Irish name, Cove, is built upon an
island. It is the paradise of naval pensioners, and the home of all
nationalities, yet Irish is still a spoken tongue not a mile away,
behind "Spy Hill." The magnificent Cathedral to St. Colman, the patron
Saint of Cloyne, occupies a commanding position over the harbour. It is
in the later florid Gothic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> architecture, and within one of its
transepts is buried the celebrated Dr. Coppinger, a learned writer and
member of the most famous and enduring of the Danish families to whom
Ireland became a native land. In an old graveyard on the island, Charles
Wolfe, the writer of the elegy on Sir John Moore, and Tobin, the
dramatist, are buried. The panorama from Spy Hill embraces the
enchanting river and the wide harbour, which is capable of holding all
the ships in the British Navy within the line drawn from the two forts,
Camden and Carlisle, which guard the entrance. Of Queenstown, the
<i>Dublin Health Record</i> says:&mdash;"The climate is remarkably mild and
equable, and, at the same time, fairly dry and tonic, and is especially
suitable as a winter and spring residence for persons with delicate
chests, to sufferers from chronic catarrhal throat affections, and to
convalescents from acute diseases. It is particularly appropriate as a
seaside resort to persons requiring a soothing and sedative atmosphere.
From the position of Queenstown, winds from the colder points are very
little felt, and it is completely protected from the north, north-east,
and north-west winds. The mean temperatures of the seasons are exactly
similar to those at Torquay, the noted winter health resort in the south
of England, and higher than those of Bournemouth, Hastings, and Ventnor.
As a winter health resort, Queenstown possesses all the best natural and
climatic advantages."</p>

<p>The beach presents the most varied and motley sights to be seen anywhere
in northern Europe. Merchant seamen from every port of the world
congregate here; military and man-of-war sailors are ever present,
pleasure-seeking yachtsmen, pilots and fishers mix with the melancholy
groups of emigrants, or the irrepressible vendors of impossible wares.
Beyond in the blue waters, His Majesty's flagship rides at anchor, one
or more of the "ocean greyhounds," with dead slow engines, are steaming
out between the forts; tenders,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> whale-boats, small steamers, tugs, and
every craft that sails the sea, down to the familiar Munster "hooker,"
are hurrying to ports far and near, or lying "idle as painted ships upon
a painted ocean." Most of the Atlantic liners have offices here. Tenders
convey the mails from the deep-water quays at the Great Southern and
Western terminus out to the steamers, which usually ride in the fair way
by the harbour's mouth. Queenstown is the principal port through which
the emigrants leave Ireland. Young and old, when the "emigration fever"
is rife, the tides of people may be seen flowing oceanwards. Sometimes
they have a little money, and are going to better themselves; but most
usually they are going out penniless to relatives abroad, or "just
trusting in God." Not an unfrequent sight is to see bare-footed peasant
children waiting for their turn to cross the gangway which leads to the
New World. Perhaps they have nothing with them but "a pot of shamrock,"
or a little mountain thrush or orange-billed blackbird, in a wicker
cage, to make friends with "beyant the herring-pond." It is very
curious, but very Irish, that they do not at all seem to want the
sympathy that is lavished upon them by the onlookers. When they are
leaving their native place, the "neighbours" hold an "American wake,"
and in the morning, with heartrending embraces and wild caioning, give
them the last "Bannact Dea Leat"&mdash;"God's blessing be on your way"; but
when they come to Cove, the sorrow is smothered; they are buoyed up by
that trusting faith in the future which is the first fibre in the Irish
nature. They may look melancholy to us, but they themselves make merry,
and before the "big ship" is but on the "Old Sea," as the Atlantic is
called, the girls and young men are slipping through rollicking reels to
improvised music "to show their heart's deep sorrow they are scorning."
Perhaps, as the Gaelic proverb expresses it, "'Tis the heavy heart that
has the lightest foot." But a truce to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> trouble. They tell a story of an
emigrant and a grand trunk merchant at Queenstown which shows alike the
hapless condition and happy-go-lucky heart of the Irishman. "Pat," said
the merchant, "you're going to travel; will you buy a trunk?" "A trunk,"
answered Pat, "an' for what, yerra?" "To put your clothes in, of
course." "And meself go naked, is it? Och! lave off your gladiatoring;
sure it's took up I'd be if I did that!"</p>

<p><b>Crosshaven</b> and <b>Aghada</b>, two watering places inside the harbour, are
within easy reach of Cove by steamer, which calls at Currabinny Pier.
The Owenabwee<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> river runs between Currabinny and Crosshaven; it is a
beautiful, well-wooded stream which has been celebrated in a
plaintive-aired Jacobite ballad, the "Lament of the Irish Maiden."</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"On Carrigdhoun the heath is brown,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The clouds are dark on Ardnalee,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And many a stream comes rushing down</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">To swell the angry Owenabwee.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The moaning blast is whistling fast</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Through many a leafless tree,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But I'm alone, for he is gone,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">My hawk is flown, ochone machree."</span><br />
</p>

<p>A few hundred yards from Crosshaven river there is a fiord of the
Owenabwee, known as Drake's Pool. Here the great soldier-sailor, Sir
Francis Drake, with his five little sloops, hid in 1587 from a
formidable Spanish fleet. The Spaniards entered the harbour, but failing
to find their quarry, put to sea again in high dudgeon.</p>

<p>Near <b>Aghada</b>, at the other side of the harbour, is Rostellan Castle,
formerly the residence of the Lords of Thomond. <b>Cloyne</b> is only four
miles' drive "on the long car" through a rich countryside, and on the
way may be seen a Druidical cromlech, at Castlemartyr, in a very fair
state of preservation. Cloyne Round Tower "points its long fingers to
the sky" above the ancient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> church wherein there is a fine alabaster
statue of the metaphysician, Dr. Berkeley, who was Bishop of Cloyne.
<b>Ballycotton</b> is seven miles from Cloyne. The cliffs here are high and
wild, and Youghal, shining white in the sun in summer weather, can be
easily seen at the mouth of the far-famed Blackwater. There are modern
hotels and moderate lodgings at Ballycotton. In the season splendid
deep-sea fishing can be had in the vicinity, and the opportunities of
sea-bathing are enticing.</p>

<h2>The River Blackwater, Youghal, Etc.</h2>


<p>Edmund Spenser spent most of his time in Cork County, at Kilcoleman
Castle in the vicinity of Buttevant. The place was well chosen as the
house of a poet. The surrounding country is very beautiful, and every
mountain and glen has its story.</p>

<p>The town of <b>Buttevant</b> took its name from the battle-cry of the
Barrymores&mdash;"Boutez-en-avant," "push forward." The ruins of the
beautiful Abbey remain. At the time of the supervision of monasteries it
was described as "a nest of abbots." Buttevant is the railway station
for Doneraile, and hard by is Cahirmee, where the greatest horse fair in
the British Isles is annually held. The fair lasts for two days. It is
held about midsummer, and attracts buyers not only from all parts of
these countries, but from as far away as Vienna and Stockholm. Spenser
pays tribute to the beautiful Blackwater which flows through Mallow to
Youghal&mdash;</p>

<p class='center'>
"Swift Annsduff, which of the English is called Blackwater."
</p>

<p>Far away in the highland country between Cork and Kerry the stream
rises, and comes floating and pushing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> down from the haunt of the
fairies and the outlaw, through the wild country of Meelin. Here is a
remarkable cave, the hiding place of Donald O'Keeffe, last of the old
chiefs of the land of Duhallow, who was outlawed after the fall of the
Jacobites.</p>

<h4>In the Woods at Buttevant.</h4>

<p>The river flows through Newmarket, the birthplace of Curran, and
Kanturk, the birthplace of Barry Yelverton, to <b>Mallow</b> which is the
centre of the lines of railway radiating into Kerry, Fermoy, and
Lismore, as well as to Cork city. The town is very beautifully situated.
In the distance are the Kilworth mountains, which seem afar off to join
the ample deer-park at Mallow Castle. It was once one of the liveliest
and most fashionable resorts in Ireland, but its famous spas, to which
gentlewomen and gallants came in the last <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>century, are now unfrequented
and almost forgotten. When abductions, duelling, and such pastimes were
in vogue, "The Rakes of Mallow" were in their heyday. As Lysaght sang:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>The Blackwater</b> flows past Mallow through a rich country surrounded by
soft-breasted hills and well-planted lawns, to Fermoy, a garrison town
of importance, from which Mitchelstown, eleven miles away, may be
reached by a light railway. The caves at Mitchelstown are described
elsewhere (Waterford section). We will part the branch line here and
return, <i>via</i> Cork, to Youghal, the point from which to become familiar
with the Blackwater at its best.</p>

<p><b>Youghal</b>, except in summer-time, when the visitors to its splendid
strand enliven its appearance, is a sombre old place with an air of
retired respectability. It is full of memories of other days, for here
the Dane and the Christian came together; the Norman made it a walled
town, and the Spaniards came into its harbour.</p>

<h4>Sir Walter Raleigh's House at Youghal.</h4>

<p>From here Sir Walter Raleigh, its Mayor, went forth to found
Virginia&mdash;and to the scaffold. It was a chartered city, and grew in
wealth and importance from 1183 to 1579, when it was sacked by Gerald,
sixteenth Earl of Desmond, then out "upon his keeping." Ormonde drove
the Geraldines out of the town, and hanged the then Mayor outside his
own door for aiding them. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> rebuilt its walls, and placed here a
strong garrison. In 1641 it was again besieged, but held out for six
weeks until relieved. In 1645, Castlehaven attacked it, but was repulsed
by Broghill, fifth son of the Earl of Cork. Here, during the war with
the Confederates, money was struck. On the execution of Charles I.,
Ormonde proclaimed his son King, but the Puritans in the town<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> revolted
to Cromwell, who wintered here in 1649. In 1660, the Cavaliers and
broken followers of the Geraldines captured the town, and ten days
before his actual succession proclaimed Charles II. King. With varying
fortunes of war, the town passed into the hands of the Jacobites and
Williamites. The objects of interest, besides the picturesque
attractions of the strand and beautiful bay, are very many. The Clock
Tower remains where the old South Gate to the town stood. Tynte's Castle
was built by Norman settlers in the fifteenth century. St. Mary's
Cathedral is cruciform, consisting of nave, aisle, transepts, choir, and
massive tower. In the chantry of Our Blessed Saviour, or south transept,
besides the memorial to the founder and his countess, is the grotesque
mausoleum, in florid, glaring Italian style, to the Earl of Cork and his
family. At Boyle's feet is the kneeling figure of his first wife, Joan;
at his head is that of his second, Catherine. Over the arch is his
mother, Joan, and along the margin of the plinth are nine diminutive
effigies&mdash;his children. The tower was evidently constructed rather as a
defence than simply for a belfry. The churchyard, where there are many
ancient gravestones, is the chief centre of local superstition, and here
all local ghostly visitations are alleged to take place. <b>Myrtle Grove</b>,
whilom the residence of the ill-fated Elizabethan soldier, Raleigh, is
an unpretentious, ancient gabled dwelling. The interior is remarkable
for its beautiful oak wainscoting.</p>

<p>During his sojourn in Munster, "Captain Sir Walter Raleigh" performed
many deeds of dering-do, albeit some of them were far from being like
Bayard's, without reproach. He was Mayor of Youghal, 1588-9; and, with
Spenser, was granted the greater<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> part of the forfeited estates of the
Earl of Desmond. Raleigh's grant comprised property at Youghal and along
the Blackwater to Affane, already mentioned. In the garden attached to
Myrtle Grove he is supposed to have planted the potato, the first
planted in Ireland.</p>

<p>The strand at Youghal is very fine, and sea-bathers are afforded every
opportunity of enjoying themselves. In summer time the watering-place is
much patronized, and every year is becoming more attractive. There are
good hotels, and plenty of residences and lodgings to accommodate
visitors during the season. In the morning the whole fore-shore is given
over to the bathers, and in the evenings it is mostly "Oh, listen to the
band" along the Promenade and in the Green Park. The inroads of the sea
at Claycastle are at length being successfully encountered by the Case
groining system, which has been found so efficient elsewhere.</p>

<p>The coast-line from Youghal to Cork is indented with splendid sea
cliffs, fiords, and strands. Garryvoe lies between Youghal and
Ballycotton. The sea for miles along this district has been eating into
the clay cliffs, and threatens to fulfil a Gaelic prophecy that it will
yet reach Killeagh, a town six miles inland. Near Killeagh is a very
beautiful scene of sylvan splendour, Glenbower.</p>

<p>The railway line runs direct from Youghal to Cork, passing the thriving
market town of Midleton, the granary of Cork County, and Carrigtwohill,
where there are the ruins of a Norman Castle.</p>

<p>A ferry from Youghal brings the passenger into Waterford County. The
road above Whiting Bay leads to the fishing village of <b>Ardmore</b>. It was
perhaps, the first place in Ireland where the light of Christianity
shone, as St. Declan is generally agreed to have been a precursor of the
National apostle. In the country districts surrounding, as in the
fishing village itself, the language most in use is Gaelic. The round
tower, said to be of later date than any other in Ireland, is unique in
many respects. The Cathedral,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> with its exquisite chancel arch and
elaborate exterior arcading, will delight the antiquary and architect.
Other interesting objects are the Ogham stones in its chancel, and the
narrow lintelled "Bed" of St. Declan.</p>

<h4>Strancally Castle, Co. Waterford.</h4>


<p>The service of steamers from Youghal to Cappoquin up the <b>River
Blackwater</b> depends at present mainly on the state of the tide. But
despite this and other things, the scenery on the river side will well
repay inconvenience. Having left the ferry behind, the first place of
interest is Rhincrew (The Bloody Point), and on the wooded hill the
ruins of a preceptory of the Knights Templars still remain. Higher up on
the western bank of the Glendine tributary stands Temple Michael,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> an
old fortalice of the Geraldines, which Cromwell battered down for "dire
insolence."</p>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/img107.jpg" alt="Blackwater River" title="Blackwater River" /></div>

<p class='center'><i>Photo&mdash;Lawrence, Dublin.</i></p>

<h4>Blackwater River.</h4>


<p>There is a legend which tells that the last of the Geraldines was buried
at Ardmore, far from his young bride, who lost her life during the siege
by the regicides. The story says, after his burial, at night his voice
could be heard clearly, calling across the river, to bring him back and
bury him by his own. For seven years the awe-struck peasants heard the
plaintive voice calling, in the tender tongue of the Gael, "Garault,
come to me,"&mdash;"Gerald, a ferry!" At last, some young men of his clan
went to Ardmore and brought his dead body to Temple Michael, where his
wife was buried, and henceforth his spirit no longer troubled the silent
vigils of the fishermen at night.</p>

<p>The bend in the waterway brings one into sight of rich pastures and fine
demesnes. Ballintray, "The Town of the Strand" has in its vicinity
Molana Abbey, where the warrior, Raymond Le Gros, lies buried. At the
broads of Clashmore, the highest water-mark to which the inflowing tide
comes, one can easily imagine themselves upon an inland lake. Beyond is
Strancally Castle, beetling over the river, set firmly in a foundation
of crags. The local tradition carriers will gladly point out "The
Murdering Hole," a natural fissure in the rocks, and here they will tell
you that the departed Desmonds destroyed their guests after robbing
them! Above the confluence of the Bride with the Blackwater,
Villierstown and Camphire villages are passed, then the Awbeg joins its
little flood, and beyond the island Dromana Ford is reached. Near is
Dromana Castle, where "the old Countess of Desmond" was born. In the
table-book of Robert Sydney, second Earl of Leyicester, written when
Ambassador at Paris, about 1640, there is the following reference to
her:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The old Countess of Desmond was a marryed woman in Edward IV. time
of England, and lived till towards the end of Queen Elizabeth, so
as she must needes be neare one hundred and forty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> years old. She
had a new sett of teeth not long afore her death, and might have
lived much longer had she not mett with a kind of violent death,
for she would needes climbe a nut-tree to gather nuts, so falling
down she hurt her thigh, which brought a fever, and that fever
brought death. This my cousin, Walter Fitzwilliam, told me. This
old lady, Mr. Haniot told me, came to petition the Queen, and,
landing at Bristoll, she came on foot to London, being then so old
that her daughter was decrepit, and not able to come with her."</p></div>

<p>Dromana House, on the eastern branch of the river, is situated on a
beautiful height, which commands the reaches of the river from Cappoquin
to Youghal. At more than one point on the river there were opportunities
of seeing in the distance the cloisters of <b>Mount Melleray</b>&mdash;"the little
town of God," lonely above the mists and shadows of the hills. As we
walk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span> or drive, the hillside behind the river winds its way through
cliffs and well-wooded lands in front, the mountains unfold themselves
range behind range. No one who has ever visited Mount Melleray will
forget it or the generous Brothers. The Trappists, expelled from France
in 1830, first settled on the borders of Kerry, but subsequently
colonised this barren hillside, and already they have transformed it
into a fine farm, containing rich pastures and thriving plantations. The
monastery may be visited by gentlemen visitors, and cannot fail to prove
of extraordinary interest. There are two guest houses, one for gentlemen
and the other for ladies. No charge is made for their bed or board, and
all creeds, classes, and nationalities are received with a <i>caed mille
failt&eacute;</i>. Every week a sermon in Irish is preached to the mountaineers.</p>

<h4>Mount Melleray&mdash;View from South.</h4>

<p>Either from Melleray or Cappoquin, <b>Lismore</b> may be reached by car or
train. It was the home of learning of old, and to-day, not only its
beautiful position but historic Castle command attention. It is the
birthplace of Boyle, the philosopher. Ptolemy is asserted very
confidently by some authorities to have mentioned this place and its
river. It is certain, however, that the place was long in existence in
631, when St. Carthage, of Rahan, fled thither. Nothing could be
prettier than the appearance of the town, and it is a comfortable,
well-to-do place, monopolising the trade of a large countryside. St.
Machuda's Cathedral will repay inspection. The Castle is the Irish seat
of the Duke of Devonshire. It was an ancient fortress, dating back to
the reign of King John. It stands in a pre-eminently commanding
position, over the Blackwater, and was the scene of many a hard-fought
fight, especially in the wars of the Commonwealth, when Castlehaven
captured it from the Roundheads. A magnificent view of the surrounding
country may be had from its higher-storied windows. The public are
freely admitted. From one of the high windows, it is said, when James
II. was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> asked to look, he accused the maker of the suggestion of
desiring to throw him from the dizzy height.</p>

<p>From the Railway Station at Lismore, the most interesting object in view
is the new Roman Catholic Cathedral, dedicated to St. Carthage, the
founder of the See, and believed to occupy the site of his cell. Thickly
surrounded by beautiful lime trees, the warm red sandstones of the
walling, with the limestone dressing of the windows and doorways, forms
a brilliant picture. The interior is richly furnished, and altogether
the church is well worthy of a visit.</p>

<h2>Waterford and District.</h2>


<p>Waterford is the port of call for most of the shipping from the West and
South of England and Wales. The projected system by which steamers will
run direct from Fishguard to Rosslare Harbour, whatever effect it may
have upon Waterford as a port, will bring it by many hours nearer to the
English markets. It is only a question of a few years until this route
will be at the disposal of tourists and travellers from across the
Channel. Under the Amalgamation of Railways Act of 1900, Waterford has
the additional advantage of becoming a terminus of the system. With it
as centre, railway services are supplied to Cork County and Lismore, to
Limerick <i>via</i> Carrick-on-Suir and Clonmel, and to Kilkenny <i>via</i>
Kilmacow and Thomastown.</p>

<h4>Waterford, from North Side of River.</h4>

<p>"The Star of the Suir"&mdash;the City of <b>Waterford</b>&mdash;derived its name from
the Danish words, Vedr-fiord, given to it by its original founders, the
hardy Norsemen. From whatever side we approach the old town, whether
land or sea, the sight is equally delightful. From without, approaching
by the broad waterway, the city stretches forth to meet us, with the
quaint wooden bridge spanning the noble river, and the hills forming a
zone behind. Surely the Danes had an eye for beauty, as for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> maritime
advantage, in selecting this happy spot for their fortress. In the ninth
century, when the ploughers of the sea seized on the mouth of the Suir,
they fortified a little delta some twenty acres in size, having the
present Quay as its long side. From this little triangle the town grew,
and in the last century was one of the first seaport towns in Ireland.
Here, in 1171, Strongbow landed, defeated the Danes and Irish, who had
confederated to repel him, and sacked the town. It is a strange
historical coincidence that the Feast of St. Bartholomew was the day on
which Strongbow landed and countenanced the massacre of the inhabitants.
Under Raymond Le Gros the carnage was carried out, and in St. Lawrence
O'Toole's address to the Irish princes at peace with the invader, which
has been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> versified by Sir Charles Gavan Duffy, it is referred to in the
lines:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Tell me not of leagues and treaties,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Treaties sealed in faith as true</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As Black Raymond's, on the bloody</span><br />

<p class='center'><i>Photo&mdash;Croker, Waterford.</i></p>

<h4>The Quays, Waterford.</h4>

<p>King John landed here, and the town was walled in and fortified against
the Irish, who hung like wolves around a fold in the outlying country.
In the Revolution the town adhered to the King. It was the port most
used by the Confederates, and here many of their proclamations were
printed. It was the one place in Ireland which successfully resisted the
all-conquering Cromwell, and hence received the name from the Cavaliers
of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> <i>Urbs intacta</i>. An object of historic interest which has been
restored within the present century is Reginald's Tower. It was built
originally by Reginald the Dane, son of Sitrius, the great Danish King
of Dublin and Fingal (The Fair Strangers), whom Brian Boru defeated at
Clontarf. Here, it is said, DeClair married Eva, whose fair face induced
him to join his forces to her father's fallen fortunes. Maclise, in his
wonderful historical picture "Bartered Away,"<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> represents the nuptials
as taking place on the battlefield, dyed with the blood of the
vanquished Irish. There could not have been much love in the match after
all. Strongbow was scarcely dead when his young widow wrote to Raymond
Le Gros that "a great tooth had fallen out," which he understood to mean
that the time had arrived for him to come and make her his own, which he
did. The patron saints of the diocese of Waterford and Lismore are Saint
Cartach and Saint Otteran, the latter being a Dane who embraced
Christianity. The Cathedral (Episcopalian) occupies the site of the old
Danish Cathedral, the existence of which, together with that of Christ
Church in Dublin, bears testimony to the zeal with which the Danes
embraced Christianity. The Quay is the most characteristic bit of
Waterford. Across the bridge, from Mount Misery or Cromwell's Rock, two
points of vantage, excellent views of the surroundings can be had. The
Suir, shining silvery, steals in and out among the hills and by the old
town into the sea. The most interesting of the ancient monuments in
Waterford is what is commonly called the "French Church," which, more
correctly, is entitled "The Holy Ghost Friary." Authorities agree in
assigning the date of its foundation to 1240, but its history has never
been written. After the Edict of Nantes, the fugitive Huguenots formed a
little colony in Waterford. The Corporation granted a salary to their
minister, and they were provided with a place of worship in the choir of
the old church. All<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> that remain of this once gorgeous pile of
buildings are the ruins of the tower, Lady Chapel, chancel, and nave.
The style is Early English, and the most attractive feature is the
graceful three-lighted east window. The Catholic Cathedral is worth a
visit. Within easy reach of the Quay is Ballybricken, the heart of the
bacon industry, and the home of the best known body of pig-buyers in
Ireland. These men are almost a community to themselves. They have their
own traditions, and are more like an organisation which would have
sprung up from a church guild centuries ago than in any way a modern
trades union. Formerly Waterford was remarkable for the manufacture of
beautiful cut glass, but the industry has died away. The housekeeper who
possesses specimens of the art considers herself lucky indeed in her
possession, as collectors are continually on the alert to procure them.
In the immediate vicinity of Waterford itself there are many beauty
spots and places of interest. In the suburb of Newtown stands the
paternal home of Lord Roberts of Waterford and Candahar, besides whom on
its roll of famous children Waterford includes the names of Charles
Keane and Vincent Wallace. Portlaw, four and a half miles away, on the
south bank of the Suir, was once the centre of a thriving cotton
industry. Here an order may be had at the estate office to visit
Curraghmore, the residence of the Marquis of Waterford. The magnificent
demesne includes over four thousand acres, and Curraghmore is possessed
of the best-blooded stud of hunters in Ireland.</p>

<h4>Tramore.</h4>

<p><b>Tramore</b>, seven miles away, is reached by train in fifteen minutes. It
is one of the most popular watering places in the South of Ireland, and
in the height of the season it is estimated that about four thousand
visitors augment the normal population of two thousand. Many of the
Waterford merchants live there, and their villas and the houses of the
town, rising one street above another on the side of the hill, make a
pretty picture when viewed from the strand. The hotels are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> numerous,
the Grand Hotel can be recommended as being specially comfortable, while
there are three or four other hotels where very good accommodation can
be had. The lodging-house accommodation is equal to that to be obtained
at any Irish seaside resort.</p>

<h4>Evening at Tramore.</h4>


<p>In addition to capital sea and trout fishing, the visitor can enjoy the
pleasures of golf and lawn-tennis, and during the summer months races
are frequently held at the Tramore Flying Course, which is situated
within view of the town. The views of this pleasantly situated holiday
reunion will recall to many minds happy days spent by the Sounding Sea.</p>

<p>The Rabbit Burrow, a little further on, is a mile in length, and helps
to divide the Back Strand from the spacious bay. Just before reaching
this Burrow, the visitor will see a tombstone erected to the memory of
those who were lost in the "Sea Horse" transport, in January, 1816, when
returning from the Peninsular Campaign. No less than 362 lost their
lives in this terrible disaster. At the western side of Tramore there
are many places along the rock-bound coast well worth a visit. Passing
along in the Newtown direction we come in view of the Ladies' Cove;
here, years ago, a fishing pier was built by the Board of Works. It was
swept right away one stormy night over two decades ago, and has not been
replaced since. Along the Cliff Road we catch views of Gun's Cove, and
the Gillameen Cove, where excellent bathing facilities, free of charge,
can be availed of by the visitor.</p>

<p>On the western shore, twelve miles by road from Waterford, is the pretty
watering place of <b>Dunmore</b>. It is situated at the mouth of the river
Suir in a valley gently sloping to the sea, and is protected from the
north winds by a wood which, in the hot summer days, is a most
delightful resort for visitors. There is also a public park and tennis
ground, and the facilities for bathing, particularly for gentlemen,
leave nothing to be desired.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>In the early part of the last century the place was a mail packet
station for the mails to and from England. The harbour was built by the
Government at a cost of about &pound;100,000, and is at present under the
control of the Board of Works. Here, in the fishing season, are boats
from all parts of the Kingdom fishing for herring and mackerel, and
special steamers are constantly running to and from Milford with the
harvest of the sea.</p>

<p>There are some particularly good villas and houses which can be rented
in the season, and there is a good hotel just over the harbour, while
rooms are to be had on reasonable terms at many houses in the town. For
persons who desire a select quiet place to spend a holiday in, it can be
recommended strongly, while for those who are fond of sea-fishing or
yachting no better place in Ireland can be had. Although there is no
railway connection with Waterford cars run daily, the fare being only
<i>1s.</i> for the twelve miles.</p>

<p>Above the confluence of the Barrow and Suir, six and a half miles from
the city, from the top of the hill over Cheekpoint (Side a fairy)&mdash;where
"the river Rosse meets the river of Waterford"&mdash;a grand panorama
presents itself. In the distance the mountains shoulder one another for
prominence; the Comeraghs, the many peaked Galtees, and</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Sweet Slievenamon, the darling and pride,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With soft flowing bosom and brow like a bride."</span><br />
</p>

<p>This beautiful mountain owes its name, "The Hill of the Women," to a
Finnian legend, which tells that Finn M'Cool promised to make his wife
of whichever of the fair women of Ireland could reach its summit first,
when all were started from the foot. Grainne Oge, the Gaelic Helen, of
course was heroine of the day, and Finn's taking her was the origin of
one of the most enthralling of the Celtic romances.</p>

<h4>Dunmore Harbour.</h4>


<p>Among the more interesting objects at Dunbrody are St. Catherine's
Church, an old time dependency of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> Abbey, and the splendid remains
of the Cistercian Monastery, rising above the meadows by which the
Campile Stream flows. The monastic church in general style is Early
English, and is fairly preserved. It dates from the twelfth century, and
was founded by Henri de Montmorenzi, Marshal to Henry II.&mdash;the same who
was killed at the Curragh.</p>

<p>There is a severe simplicity about its lines which gives an impression
of great dignity. The crenelated Tower springs from the nave and
transept. The Abbots of Dunbrody sat as Lords in Parliament, and
exercised civil jurisdiction. Above Dunbrody, on the river opposite "The
Little Island," where was an ancient hermitage, in a straight line is
Ballinakill House, where James II. spent his last night in Ireland, on
the day before that celebrated in the ballad, which tells:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Righ Shemus he has gone to France,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And left his crown behind,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Put running in his mind."</span><br />
</p>

<p><b>Passage East</b> (seven miles), now a fishing village, with spider-legged
spit light, was reduced by Cromwell in 1649. The old mole still stands.
At Ballyhack, across the ferry, a strong, square castle is well
preserved. "New Geneva," in the vicinity, was garrisoned with Hessians
during the Rebellion of '98. It is mentioned in the well-known Irish
song, "The Croppy Boy." The place received its name in 1786, when a
colony of Genoese exiles were established there. On the Waterford coast,
from the city to where the Blackwater kisses the sea, beside a range of
noble cliffs, there are many points of interest. The Tower of Hook,
standing one hundred feet high, on the promontory of the same name on
the Wexford side, is attributed amongst others to Reginald the Dane,
Ross MacRume, the founder of New Ross, and Florence de la Hague (1172).
Its circular walls are of great thickness and strength. When Strongbow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
heard of this Tower of Hook, with Crook (Norse, Krok a nook) on the
western side, he is alleged to have said "He would take Waterford by
Hook or Crook," and thus originated a common saying which has come down
to our own days. The Saltees, two islands off the Wexford coast, were
the refuge to which Colclough and Bagnall Harvey hastened in vain after
the suppression of the Rebellion in '98. Helvick Head, the name of which
also betrays its Danish origin, marks the entrance to Dungarvan Bay. The
line running from Waterford to Limerick Junction contains many places of
interest, from which short tours may be made. As we come near to
<b>Carrick-on-Suir</b> the castle comes into view. The present building was
mainly erected by the former Earl of Ormonde, "Black Tom," as he is
known in history. He was one of the many Irish gallants who found favour
in the eyes of Queen Elizabeth. From Carrick, a drive of eight miles
brings us to Lough Coumshinawn, a lonely tarn lying high among the
Comeragh mountains, on one side of which the cliff rises perpendicularly
to a height of seven hundred feet. The railway from Carrick runs through
the beautiful valley of the Suir to Kilsheelan, and then passes to the
left of the Knockmealdown mountains to <b>Clonmel</b>, the capital of the
"premier county." The town is pleasantly placed in a thriving centre of
local trade. It figured largely in the fights between Cromwellian and
Confederate, and some of the old battlements still stand witness to its
strength in bygone times. The peasantry have a tradition that a cloud
will ever hang above the town since Father Sheehy's death in the last
century. The tradition is hinted at in the beautiful emigrant ballad
"Shameen Dhu," by Katherine Tynan:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Now, God watch over you, Shameen,</span><br />

<h4>Holy Cross Abbey at Thurles.</h4>


<p>The name of Laurence Sterne, author of "Tristram Shandy," and of the
gorgeous Countess of Blessington, are both associated with Clonmel as
their birthplace. Through a mountain cut, appropriately called "The
Wilderness," the railway line runs aside to Thurles. The little church
of Rathronan, standing high on the hill, was the scene of the
sensational Arbuthnot abduction in the last century. Those who wish for
details of that unhappy love affair will find the story told in faithful
words elsewhere. The demesne lands between Clonmel and Fethard are many.
<b>Fethard</b> was an old walled town, it defied the Cromwellians, and
surrendered with all the honours of war. After treaty and terms were
agreed on, the Roundheads found that what they had mistaken as gaping
mouths of cannon on the fortress were nothing more dangerous than
innocent churns placed in positions of pretence, not defence. The
bogland from Fethard to Thurles is uninteresting; the intermediate
stations are Farranalleen, Laffan's Bridge, and Horse and Jockey, at
which collieries are still being worked. At Thurles we meet the main
line of the Great Southern and Western. <b>Thurles</b>, originally a Danish
town and the scene of the battle between the Norsemen and Irish,
afterwards became a fortalice of the Knights Templars. Here, by the
bridge across the Suir, the remains of the old settlement are still to
be seen. Four miles distant, standing by the banks of the river,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
surrounded by tall trees, are the remains of the once great Cistercian
<b>Holy Cross Abbey</b>. It was built in 1168-69 to house the relic of the
True Cross sent by the Pope to Brian Boru's grandson, Donald, King of
Thomond. This interesting relic, after centuries of vicissitudes, is now
enshrined at the Convent of the Ursulines, in Blackrock, Cork. On the
feasts of the Finding of the True Cross (May 3rd), and of the Exaltation
of the Holy Cross (September 14th), and on every Friday in Lent, it is
presented for public veneration. Thurles is the seat of Episcopal
residence of the Archdiocese of Cashel. On the main line higher than
Thurles is Templemore, founded by the Knights Templars. Between Thurles
and the Limerick Junction is Goold's Cross station, six miles from
Cashel. The noblest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> evidence of the early civilization of Ireland is to
be found in <b>Cashel Of the Kings</b>. Generally the buildings date from the
early twelfth century, the Round Tower being much earlier and the
Cathedral later. Cormac's Chapel was consecrated in 1134, being built by
the Saint King of Munster. It is rich Norman work, comprising nave,
chancel, and towers at the transepts. The doorways and chancel arch are
elaborate. The Round Tower is unique when compared with the other
buildings, as it is of sandstone. It is connected with the transept of
the Cathedral. The pointed windows, choir, transepts, and tower are very
beautiful. In the burial-ground outside is the famous Cross of Cashel,
with a sculptured effigy of St. Patrick. The whole group gathered
together on the massive Rock of Cashel, whose firmness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> is a proverb in
Ireland, presents an imposing array. This Cathedral was the one burnt by
the Earl of Kildare in 1495, when his excuse was that he thought the
Archbishop was within. Here, in 1647, a bloody tragedy fell out.
Murragh-an-Theathaun, "Murrough of the Burnings," as the peasantry still
call Lord Inchiquin, massacred a number of women and children, who
sought sanctuary here when Cashel had fallen before his siege train. At
the foot of the rock are the cruciform remains of the Abbey of the
Cistercians. If, instead of diverging from Clonmel to Thurles, we
continue to the Limerick Junction, we pass Cahir, a military station
with an ancient Castle in excellent repair. From Cahir, tourists can
drive to Cashel, to Ardfinane, or to <b>Mitchelstown</b> <i>via</i> Clogheen. The
Caves at Mitchelstown may be visited from Fermoy, Lismore, or Clogheen,
and if the visitor is sojourning at any of these places he should find
his way to these wonderful formations. Besides the caves, Mitchelstown
contains Caherderinny Castle, Kilbehiny, and Mitchelstown Castle, the
residence of the Kingston family. Leaving the village of Kilbehiny we
cross to Skereenarinka, "the height for dancing," and follow a narrow
hilly road on the Galtee side which leads to the caves, in the townland
of Coolagarranroe. The different chambers of the larger caves, of which
the Kingston gallery is most beautiful, have been named: "the House of
Lords," "the House of Commons," "the Cross of the Four Roads," "the
Scotchman's," "O'Leary's," and "O'Callaghan's" caves, "the Altar," "the
Closet," "the Cellar," and "the Garret." The smaller objects of interest
within have been called: "Lot's Wife," "Mary Queen of Scots," "the Bed
of Honour," "the Cat and Kittens," "the Flitch of Bacon," &amp;c. From
Clogheen to Tipperary we cross the Suir, and follow the foot of the
Galtees. The surrounding country is picturesque and contains some of the
finest pasture land in Ireland, being part of what is known in Munster
as the "Golden Vale." Four miles away by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> a beautiful road, through the
rising-grounds, the Glen of Aherlow can be reached. The glen is richly
wooded, and from Newbridge over the Aherlow river, Galteemore (3,015
feet), the highest peak of the range may be reached. Tipperary town is a
good market place, and is pleasantly situated beneath Slievenamon. The
only relic of its former grandeur is that of the Augustinian Friary, a
foundation of Henry the Third's reign.</p>

<p>Killarney.&mdash;From Limerick Junction to Mallow, where the branch line runs
into Kerry, the tourist to Killarney runs by many places of interest.
<b>Emly</b>, now a dwindled village, was once a diocesan city. During the
wars of the Commonwealth, Terence Albertus O'Brien, Bishop of Emly, was
executed in Limerick by Ireton. His stole and pectoral cross are still
in the possession of representatives of the family to which he belonged
at Mitchelstown.</p>

<p>In the rich plain under the Ballyhoura hills, "the land flowing with
milk," is the ancient town of <b>Kilmallock</b>. It was the citadel of the
Earls of Desmond when they held high their crests, and every stone in
the place is historical.</p>

<p>Two of its four gates still remain, and among the ruins, which have
secured it the name of the "Baalbec of Ireland," are those of the old
Dominican Priory and Abbey Church. In the former is the mutilated grave
of the White Knight, a name still loathsome in the peasant's ear, and on
whom the bards have let fall their choicest curses.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>Lough Gur is of interest to the antiquary. It is ten miles to the north,
and was the centre of the Desmond country. Here of old, the Kings of
Cashel kept their Grenan or "Sunny Place" for feasting. The cyclopean
structure in the vicinity points to the place as being of importance in
pre-historic times. From Charleville, a thriving town, runs a line of
railway direct to Limerick. Buttevant and Mallow are particularly
referred to elsewhere. Millstreet is the border town on the mearings of
Cork and Kerry.</p>

<p>Beyond the bogland country outside Millstreet is the village of Cullen,
where tradition says no smith has been known to thrive. Saint Lateerin,
a virgin of early Christian days, near here made her recluse, and every
day she walked across the bog, and took "living fire" in her kirtle from
the forge to her home. The smith once remarking the prettiness of her
white feet, she momentarily forgot her vow of chastity, and the fire
burnt through the homespun and blistered her feet. She went back to her
cell, and prayed that no smith should ever thrive in Cullen, and none
has ever tried to do so!</p>

<p><b>Rathmore</b> is on the high road to Gneeveguillia mountain, and to the
north of the station, and at Christmas time, 1896, occurred the fearful
<i>d&eacute;b&acirc;cle</i> of the bog, which struck terror into the simple inhabitants,
and, not unnaturally, was attributed by them to super-natural causes.
Two hundred acres of Bogach-na-Mine formed a landslip and rolled in a
huge mass southwards, sweeping away several little farmsteads and
suffocating the inhabitants and cattle. At <b>Headford</b>, the junction for
Kenmare, the scenery is very wild, and all around</p>

<p>At last, after about a four hours' run, if we came by the special
tourist train from Dublin, we have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> completed our one hundred and

<p><br /></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/img135.jpg" alt="Boating at Killarney" title="Boating at Killarney" /></div>

<p>the home of lakes, which has well been called "the Gem of the Western
World": its magnificent mountain peaks, its green swards and gushing
cascades, all surrounded with an atmosphere of romance and tradition.
Outside the railway station, we are face to face with the finest hotel
in the south of Ireland. Well placed, well managed, it combines all the
comforts of a home with the convenience of a well-appointed hostelry. It
is within easy reach of the principal points of interest.</p>

<p>The grounds adjoin Lord Kenmare's beautiful demesne and Deer Park, which
skirts the lake shores, and contain the splendid Golf Links.</p>

<p>Killarney, or "the Church of the Sloetrees," lies on a flat plateau,
within a mile from the shores of the far-famed Lough Lene, as the three
lakes, popularly known as the Lakes of Killarney, are called in Irish.
The town possesses an Episcopal Palace, a cathedral and churches of
interest, besides a monastery and School of Arts and Crafts. Otherwise
it deserves little attention; but on fair days, when the peasantry from
the neighbouring parishes crowd in, it presents a lively and varying
aspect. If the town is insignificant, not so its surroundings, for
nowhere else in the wide world is there such a combination of charms and
variety of beauty, in mountain and lake scenery, thrown together.</p>

<p>There is a story of a tourist who, lingering long in the Holy Land, was
pained at the irreverent hurry of an American, who arrived there one
afternoon, scurried over the sacred places, and prepared to depart
betimes on the morrow. He timidly inquired of the swift-foot why he, who
had come so far, rushed away so quickly. "Sir," said the American, "I am
timed to do Europe in a fortnight. I have thrown in the Holy Land, but
if I stay here longer than one night I cannot see Killarney, which takes
three days." He was a wise man in his generation. Although enterprising
people have attempted to do the tour of the Lakes in a day, they have
always gone away more than satisfied with what they saw, but with hearts
hungry to return at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span> a future date, and behold the beauties they had

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/img139.jpg" alt="On the Upper Lake" title="On the Upper Lake" /></div>

<p class='center'><i>Photo&mdash;Lawrence, Dublin.</i></p>

<h4>On the Upper Lake, Killarney.</h4>


<p>The <b>Lakes Of Killarney</b> are three in number, connected by a
swift-flowing stream, the Long Range, and emptying their waters through
the river Laune into Castle Haven, on the Kerry coast. The entire
journey can be performed by boat, but in the suggested tours given, both
car, and boat, and ponies are pressed into our service.</p>

<p>The divisions of the Lough Lene are:&mdash;The Upper Lake (extreme length,
two-and-a-half miles; extreme breadth, half-a-mile); the Torc, or Middle
Lake (extreme length, two miles; extreme breadth, seven-eighths of a
mile); and the Lower Lake (extreme length, five and one-eighth miles;
extreme breadth, three miles). The first glimpse caught of the lakes,
lying like broad mirrors beneath the high mountains, is a vision of fair
delight. Like tall clansmen, Mangerton, Carnthoul, and the gathering
Cruacha dhu M'Gillicuddy&mdash;the black reeks of the McGillicuddy&mdash;muster
around, as it were, to re-tell us</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"The tale of the spell-stricken band,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">All entranced, with their bridles and broad swords in hand,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Who await but the word to give Erin her own"&mdash;</span><br />
</p>

<p>that old legend of the sleeping warriors garrisoned within the
mountain's sides, which is met with in more than one Irish county. The
Upper Lake is characterised by an untamed, peerless outline, and so near
to the mountains does it lie, that the fissures in their rugged sides
are almost countable, and the fingers of fancy almost touch the gorse on
their slopes. Gliding over its waters, we readily see in them a
land-locked sea. A ridge of the Glena mountains shuts it out from the
north, the many-peaked reeks guard the passes to the west, and to the
south stands up Derrycunnihy&mdash;"The Oak Wood of the Rabbits"&mdash;between
which and Torc is the fair bend of a Glen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> Coumagloun. Between the lips
of the Lakes and the feet of the hills there appears no distance</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Save just a trace of silver sand</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Marks where the water meets the land."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Muffling the boatmen's oars for a moment, we can realise that
indescribable solemnity with which silent nature hushes everything. Even
the countless streams that have lost their way across the highlands, in
their hurry to join the Lakes, seem to cease from babbling. But
following the sinuous Long Range when we reach the still water beneath
the Eagle's Nest, Nadanullar, is the psychological moment to awaken the
echoes that eternally haunt the frowning eyry. A bugle-call sounded here
is taken up by the barricades of rock, and is repeated even ten times
over. Small wonder that the fairy hosts are credited with passing it
along their lines! The mountains take up their dying tones of sweet
sounds, and answer it one to the other until the ear can no longer
follow it through space. The ferns and rich foliage of the mountain side
trail their long fingers in the water, and cluster and quicken among the
crevices of the rocks. Recently the Laureate visited Ireland for the
first time; hitherto this land of poetry had been to him but "the
damnable country" of the politician. He came, he saw, but Killarney
conquered; and he, like all others who have gazed upon its beauty,
renders tribute where it rightly belongs. "Damnable" is not the
adjective to apply to a heavenly land, of which he truly says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Such varied and vigorous vegetation I have seen no otherwhere; and when
one has said that, one has gone far towards awarding the prize for
natural beauty. But vegetation, at once robust and graceful, is but the
fringe and decoration of that enchanting district. The tender grace of
wood and water is set in a frame-work of hills&mdash;now stern, now ineffably
gentle, now dimpling with smiles; now frowning and rugged with impending
storm; now muffled and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> mysterious with mist, only to gaze out on you
again with clear and candid sunshine. Here the trout leaps; there the
eagle soars; and there beyond the wild deer dash through the arbutus
coverts, through which they have come to the margin of the lake to
drink, and, scared by your footstep or your oar, are away back to
crosiered bracken or heather covered moorland. But the first, the final,
the deepest and most enduring impression of Killarney is that of beauty
unspeakably tender, which puts on at times a garb of grandeur and a look
of awe, only in order to heighten by passing contrast the sense of soft
insinuating loveliness. How the missel thrushes sing, as well they may!
How the streams and runnels gurgle, and leap, and laugh! For the sound
of journeying water is never out of your ears; the feeling of the moist,
the fresh, the vernal, is never out of your heart. My companion agreed
with me, that there is nothing in England or Scotland as beautiful as
Killarney&mdash;meaning by Killarney its lakes, its streams, its hills, its

blent&mdash;constitute the most perfect and adequate loveliness that nature
presents, it surely must be owned that it has all the world over no
superior."</p>

<h4>Shooting the Rapids.</h4>



<p>Leaving the <b>Upper Lake</b> behind, and bidding adieu to the green islands
that stud its breast with arbutus and the cedars of Lebanon, the Old
Weir Bridge meets the eye. 'Neath its arch the waters come down with
foam and force, the oars are shipped, and we shoot straight through the
eye of the rapid, thanks to the strong arm and sure nerve of the
oarsmen. The beautiful reach here is the bosom "where the bright waters
meet." Amid exquisite combination of colour, a Vallambrosa strewed with
ferns, lichens, mosses, rich green hollies and arbutus with many
coloured berries, we tread our way by a passage of beauty round Dinis
Island into the <b>Middle</b> or <b>Torc Lake</b>, sheltered by the broad breast
of the mountain from which it takes its name. Like "Muckross," the
"Pleasant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span> Point of Wild Swine," the name Torc is called after the wild
boars, which in former years went "gerasening" over its slopes. Rising
abruptly, the mountain stands clear between Mangerton and Glena, the
lower sides well wooded. <b>Innis Dinish</b>, the island at the "beginning of
the waters," is the port for boats. The Cottage may be visited. The
Whirlpool, between the waters of the lake and river, has been called
O'Sullivan's Punch Bowl. Drohid-na-Brickeen, "The Bridge of Little
Trout," or Brickeen Bridge, and Doolah, where the disused marble
quarries and copper mines are still pointed out, are within a short
distance. At the estuary of the Devil's Stream, which flows through the
ravines on the mountain side, is the Devil's Island&mdash;almost
inaccessible&mdash;on which a few stunted trees manage to secure a precarious
existence. Within the little bay of Dundag is Goose Island. The rocks
and caves along the lake shores are shrouded with traditions of
O'Donoghue, Chieftain of the Glens. A long cave is called "The Wine
Cellar"; at the end is "O'Donoghue's Arm Chair"; his Butler, a solitary
crag, is called "Jackybwee." The most interesting of the fissures made
by the waters in the rock side are what the enterprising boatmen have
agreed to call "Colleen Bawn Rock." By the beautiful Glena Bay, we enter
the Lower Lake, which is the largest and most charming of the group. It
sleeps beneath the guardian heights of the Toomies Hills, and a vision
of more loveliness is nowhere to be found. Low-lying shores, to the east
and north, are jungled with the fronds of the hill ferns.</p>

<p>The highest mountain in Ireland, <b>Carrantual</b>,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> at one side lifts its
lofty brow, "crowned with tiaras fashioned in the sky." On its summit an
outlaw, known in Munster as the "Shon" or Hawk, after many sleepless
nights, footsore and weary, slept here with a prayer, "Thank God, at
last I am above all my enemies." The peasantry pronounce the name
"Carntwohill," which translated means, the left-handed or inverted
sickle. The expansiveness of the Lower Lake appears at first to minimise
its beauty, when compared with its smaller companions. But the more its
loveliness is explored, the greater the revelation of the harmony and
luxuriance of the landscape. No less than thirty-five islands, like
beauty spots of a fairy "drop scene," bedeck the silver sheen of its
surface. The largest of these, <b>Innisfallen</b>, almost midway between the
eastern and western shores, is some thirty acres in extent, and is
engirdled by leafy bowers of green trees. Shaggy sheep are couched in
repose, or are busy with its verdant lawn. In the early morning, or
tender gloaming which closes the Munster day, the holy place is</p>

<h4>Innisfallen. and The Turnpike Cap of Dunloe.</h4>


<p>Shafts of the dawning or waning sun, as the hour may be, illumine the
fair pageant. The wavering outlines<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span> of the hills make the turret-tops
to the dark green of the woods and the emerald of the meadows. The
richest of colours from hill, tree, and rock accumulate on the surface
of the Lake, burnished like silver. To-day the natural scenery is the
same as of old, and few will wonder that here a saint found delights to
prepare him in some degree for the pleasures stored in eternity. Of St.
Finian Labra we know little beyond that he was a native of Ely
O'Carroll, then a part of Munster, and was a disciple of St. Brendan.
But his spirit loiters around Innisfallen, and the most casual of
travellers will tread lightly on the ground hallowed by his footsteps.
The monastic remains are many, but by the enthusiastic antiquary alone
can their fragments and chief features be traced. "<i>The Annals of
Innisfallen</i>," which form one of the chief sources of Irish history,
were written here 600 years ago. Leaving the "Holy Island," we cross the
lake and land at the foot of the Toomies Mountains, famous in
pre-historic myths, to visit the O'Sullivan Cascade. The legend, which
is too often wasted on sceptical ears, tells that O'Sullivan, a captain
of his people, renowned amongst them for fleetness of foot and prowess
as a hunter, on one occasion went to hunt the red deer. The faint yellow
rays of morning were lighting up the eastern sky as he went forth. Gaily
the deep-mouthed dogs obeyed, sniffing the fresh breeze across the
mountain purpled with heather. Scarce had he left home when a
magnificent stag bounded across his path. Swift as the lightning flash
the dogs sprung upon the track&mdash;away across the moors and down the
glens, on the scent they went. Throughout that livelong day O'Sullivan
followed the chase, weary, tired, and thirsty, but still determined to
make the prize his own. At length night, and darkness with it, came; the
stag could be seen no more, the dogs, too, were at fault, and the scent
was lost. Disappointed, and spent with the labour of the chase, the
huntsman blew a shrill blast on his horn to call the dogs to him, and
faced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> for home across the hills. But there was a voice that, loud and
clear, called upon him&mdash;"O'Sullivan, O'Sullivan, turn back!" Brave and
fearless, like his race, he turned round, to behold before him the
centre of so many cycles of romance&mdash;Finn MacCool. "Why do you dare
chase my stag?" asked Finn. "Because it was the finest that man ever
saw," answered O'Sullivan. The answer pleased Finn MacCool.
"O'Sullivan," said he, "you are a valiant man, and have been wasted in
the long chase. You thirst, and I will give you to drink." So saying, he
stamped his huge heel upon the hard rock, and forth burst the waters,
seething and dashing as they do to this day. O'Sullivan quenched his
thirst and sped on his way.</p>

<h4>Meeting of the Waters, Killarney.</h4>

<p>From the innermost recess of the glen the water flows down, in one of
the most fascinating spots to be found within all the delicious realm of
Kerry. The ivy hangs in dense draperies from the rocks, a sweet disorder
of arbutus, evergreens, and all the flowers that grow in a radiant land,
daringly lean across the canyon, and vainly try to trip the rushing
stream, which, in cascade after cascade, flings itself with passionate
energy, and a ceaseless murmur, over the rocks. The placidness of the
huge lake is in strange contrast to the noisy stream which so excitedly
hastens to meet it, and, as if awed by its dignity, as it comes nearer
and nearer the mountain stream, sinks its voice, until in a subdued sigh
it falls into the breast of the lake. Underneath the projecting rock,
and overhung with luxuriant herbs, O'Sullivan's Grotto offers a quiet
retreat. Following the wooded shores of Glena Bay, we pass Stags, Burnt,
and other islands, and come to Glena Cottage, hiding in the foliage of
leafy trees. Glena means "the valley of good fortune," and a name more
suggestive of happier thoughts than weird Glownamorra across the
lake&mdash;"the glen of the dead."</p>

<h4>Muckross Abbey, Killarney.</h4>


<p>A mile's drive through the pleasant demesne lands of Muckross brings us
to the water's edge at Castlelough<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> Bay, in the middle lake, on a
promontry of which the ruins of <b>Muckross Abbey</b> are to be seen. Here,
in the fifteenth century, Donald M'Carthy founded an Abbey for
Franciscan friars. The quiet cloisters in the northwest transept, with
their varying pointed and rounded arches, are unique. The recessed
doorway by which we enter is very beautiful. The towers and east window
are in fair preservation. The monuments within the ruined pile tell us
that it</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 13em;">"contains</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">In death's embrace M'Carthy More's remains,"</span><br />
</p>

<p>and also reminds us that</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"If Erin's chiefs deserve a generous tear,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Heir of their worth, O'Donoghue lies here."</span><br />
</p>

<p>In the centre of the cloisters there grows a great yew tree, spreading
its many branches and shade over them, and above the side walls, forming
a dark cowl, which overshadows the old house of the monks. In ancient
Erin the yew tree was regarded as sacred, and in its shade the Druids
performed their mystic rites. With the early Christians, as an
evergreen, it was a symbol of Life Eternal.</p>

<p>The peasants still inherit some of the awe with which the sacred tree
was held in former days, and they are loth to hurt it with the loss of a
single leaf. All impressive is the desolate majesty of Muckross,
whatever time it is visited!</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"But the gay beams of lightsome day</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Gild but to flout the ruins grey."</span><br />
</p>

<p>At night, when the pale ghost of the moon looks across the lake, when
the mountains are shrouded in shadows, when the waters are lulling the
slumbering land,</p>

<p class='center'>
"And the owlet hoots o'er the dead man's grave,"</p>

<p>the solemnity of the scene surpasses even that of fair<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> Melrose, by the
distant Tweed, of which Sir Walter Scott tells.</p>

<p>Driving past the modern mansion in the demesne, along <b>Torc Lake</b>, by
the groves of Dinis, and through the arches of the Old Weir Bridge, the
river glistens and sparkles in the sun, while the distant calmer water
lies deep in sleepy shadows. Beyond the peculiar rock<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> known as the
White Deer we pass through the Tunnel cut under the huge slope of the
mountains. Here is a point of view which fascinates all visitors, and
from which an ample picture of the surroundings may be secured. A mile
further we cross the Galway river, rushing down a well-worn channel
through Cournaglown, the valley sides of which are covered with oak
trees. Already the ceaseless chorus of Derrycunnihy Cascade fills our
ears. With tumult and cries of havoc, the water springs from an altitude
on the mountain side, dividing its force into many minor cataracts, as
it forces the passage barricaded by rocks and boulders, to unite them
again in a deep pool, and after a second's rest, it musters its full
strength, and falls in a torrent towards the Middle Lake. Colman's Leap,
across the stream beneath the Eagle's Nest, is shown here, and of it a
legend similar to others in many parts of Ireland is told. A mile
eastward, along the Kenmare road, we come to <b>Torc Waterfall</b>, lovely as
a capricious <i>colleen</i>, whose modes are all the more "deludering" for
their uncertainty&mdash;Torc, whether tripping gently or rushing angrily, "to
one thing constant never," makes its bed in a fairy realm, a leafy
garden of ever-changing beauty. Larch and alder, arbutus, oak, and hazel
thickly curtain the Fall from the passing glance. But a sylvan path
o'erstrewn with leaves, and bordered with many fronded ferns, discovers
the fountain in full bearing. White with foam, and angry for its long
delay in the grip of Mangerton, and the hollow of the Devil's Punch
Bowl, the flood breaks through the wall of rocks seventy feet high, and
spits a shower of spray on every futile thing which attempts to stem its
course or stay its purpose. The panorama spread out beneath the rocks of
Torc comprehends, in all their glory of colour and contrast, the Middle
and Lower Lakes beneath the mountains.</p>

direct from Killarney, within sight of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> the <b>Lower Lake</b> and the Purple
Mountains, are the ruins of Aghadoe, the "Church of the two Yew Trees,"
founded under the blessing of Saint Finian. The remains of the Round
Tower and Abbot's Castle can still be seen, but these and the eighth
century doorway of the old church are all that have weathered the wind
of centuries. The summit of the old tower is a vantage point for a
vista. Dr. Todhunter has written a beautiful ballad, in imitation of the
passionate Irish laments, for an outlaw who was buried there.</p>

<h4>The Gap of Dunloe.</h4>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>The nearest boat place for Innisfallen is at <b>Ross Castle</b>. We approach
it from the high road across the moat, where once the drawbridge was let
up and down. The old keep, wearing a cotamore of ivy, still guards the
water's edge. By a spiral stone staircase we reach the battlements and
look out across the lake.</p>

<p>The Castle held out for Charles the First, but was dismantled by Ludlow.
It was originally a fort of "The O'Donoghue," the chief who centres in
the many traditions which the boatmen weave around every object of
interest in Killarney. He lies enchanted beneath the lake, with a city
full of his people. But at times he has come across the water on his
fiery steed, or danced to the Rincead-fadda on the shores. Whoever sees
him is fortunate, because he gives "good luck, which is better than
money," to all whose eyes meet his.</p>

<p>The <b>Gap of Dunloe</b> is a gloomy mountain pass cut through the rough
rocky slope in the hills between the Toomies and the Macgillicuddy's
Reeks. It is a magnificent defile, four miles long. The rough
bridle-path running through it, at times almost on the edge of
precipices, beneath which the wild goats flock. It is approached by a
winding road, embroidered on one side by a shady little grove of fir,
larch, stunted oaks, and mountain ash. Through the little windows
between the trees, when the sun shines, the reflection of the river Loe
is caught, as it creeps humbly on its way to the lakes. On the other
side, the mountains throw up a huge wall. Bidding good-bye to the little
grove, vegetation seems to fear to enter the desolate, sterile places in
the throat of the Gap. Where the river widens, at Cushvalley Lough, the
industrious echo-makers most usually greet the visitor. One has scarcely
recovered from the warmth of their courteous welcome, when some
suggestive volunteer, aborigine to the place, with a "Mr. Bugler, God
spare you your wind," secures their services; although you do not call
the tune, you are expected to pay the musicians. But the trifle spent
on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> the gunpowder for their cannons, or the breath from their lungs, is
well repaid by the mighty mass of air they start into waves of music.
Here, too, the "auxiliary forces," or pony boys, besiege us with their
sure-footed, shaggy "coppaleens." They have come galloping down the pass
at break-neck speed to lend us the assistance of their light cavalry.
Wonderful creatures they are, these horses and riders. The peasant boys
are for all the world the modern prototypes of those "rake-helly horse
boys" of Queen Elizabeth's reign, who filled so many pages of the State
papers. Sinew and muscle knit their loose limbs together, and, in their
eyes, mild and calm as those of the quiet cattle in the field, but like
the surface of their native lakes, covering unfathomed depths, they
conceal souls swept by deep thoughts, and minds clouded by many
memories. The long unrenewed, but still to be distinguished, Spanish
strain is shown in many of their olive-tinted faces and dark features.
But guides safe, and true, and courteous are they, who know every perch
of the dark Pass, where at times the craggy cliffs shut out the canopy
of the sky, and attempt to precipitate themselves across the track. The
point where the path is narrowest, the peasants have called the "Pike."
From it onward the mountains begin to recede, and the Pass is more open
until, crossing a shoulder of the <b>Purple Mountain</b> past the three great
expansions of the Commeen Thomeen Lakes, into which St. Patrick is said
to have driven the last serpent, we suddenly come on a surprising
spectacle of magnificent scenery. Here, from the head of the Gap, we see
the Upper Lake spread beneath, to the west, Coomeenduff, or the Black
Valley, dark as the valley of the shadow of death, in charming contrast
with the stern grandeur of the mountains. Their melancholy seems to
reign supreme; the long valley is steeped with shadows in which several
lakes are set, the light upon which only heightens the sublime darkness
of the surroundings. The longest of these lakes is called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> Lough
Nabricderg, or the "Pool of the Red Trout." Far and wide beneath us lies
what, in the old times, was MacCarthy More's country, and into which so
often the Fiery Cross was sped, when the chief of the great clan went
into action.</p>

<p>Ruskin's ideals of mountains as the great cathedrals of the earth, with
their gates of rock, pavements of cloud, choirs of stream and stone,
altars of snow, and vaults of purple, traversed by the continual stars,
can nowhere be realized more readily than in Killarney. Here the
mysterious summits, warm with the morning tints or evening's glow, will
delight and refresh again and again, and reflect to us imperishable
memories. Crossing the Flesk, if <b>Mangerton</b> be the desired point, seven
good miles are to be traversed. From the Muckross, a short detour will,
if desired, lead to Flesk Castle, standing on a finely wooded hill above
the wide sweeping river. Eastward, along the Kenmare road, and southward
for a mile, the mountain path is met. From here, either on foot or on a
pony, the ascent of Mangerton may be made. The first important object
that comes in view is Lough Kittane, at the eastern base of the
mountain. It is nearly five miles in circumference, and its waters
contain four islands. The ravine behind the lake, with Mangerton on the
west and Crohane mountain on the east, is the "mustering place of the
winds," Coomnageeha. In this ravine the Blackwater flows. There are two
small lakes, Loughnabraude and "the Lake of Beech-crowned Rock," Lough
Carrigaveha. Away in the bed of the mountains is Keimva Lochlin&mdash;the
pass of the Danes&mdash;reminding the historian of "Stern Lochlin's sons of
roving war," and Dereenanawlar, or "the little oakwood of eagles."
Moving still higher, eastward the mountains melt into the distant
counties of Cork and Limerick, and beneath, the smaller highlands recall
the Psalmist's description of</p>

<p class='center'>
"The hills like the lambs of the flock."

<p>To the left, Glown-a-Coppal, the "Horse's Glen," invites the adventurous
to fathom its depths. The dark lakes lying in its shadows are shoreless,
but for the gloomy rocks which overhang the water's edge. Where the
ground becomes more broken and rugged, suddenly a less inaccessible path
arises, and leads to the Devil's Punch Bowl, a dark tarn, beset with
strange echoes that strike a death-song on the heart-strings of the
superstitious. The view from the summit is very wonderful; in the
foreground of the huge picture, the forest of mountain tops, while
westward in the distance is the fabled and saint-blessed Mare
Brendanicum of the old writers, where the fiords embroider the coast
line.</p>

<p>Descents from Mangerton may be made due south from the eastern angle
along the Oubeg to Kilgarvan, five miles east from Kenmare; by the
"Horse's Glen," from Lough Garagary, across the moor to the commencement
of the bridle-path. Neither way is recommended in the afternoon or
without a guide. The best route to Carntuol is from the entrance to the
Gap of Dunloe. There is a beaten track by the side of the waterway of
the mountain stream, called "Giddagh," the bed of which is filled with
glacial moraines, leading into a romantic valley, the Hag's Glen, which
is shut in by the Reeks and Knocknabinaneen. The dark tarn in the Glen,
as well as every object of prominence, has been seized upon by the
imaginative peasants, and associated in some wise with the witch who
here had her local habitation and left it its name. The track across the
heather leads to the junction of two rivulets from Lough Gonvogh on the
right, and Lough Callee on the left. The beginning of the summit is
reached by the rough moraine pavement, and with a little perseverance
the "parkeen," or "little pasture," on top is reached. Here on the
wind-swept height it is interesting to find the <i>London Pride</i>, or <i>St.
Patrick's Cabbage</i>, and the common <i>Thrift</i> flourishing The view is
indescribable. Like the jaws of some huge monster, the teeth of the
Reeks close in everywhere,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> each with its own blue lake behind. Of
Killarney we see little; but seawards "everything between this end of
the world and America," descent may be made, either following the flank
of the hill, and half way between the two largest lakes beneath,
striking for the Gap of Dunloe road, or through Coomduff to the shores
of the Upper Lake.</p>

<p>When the tourist's time is limited, the following excursions, extending
over three days, will enable him to see a good many of the points of
interest:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<h4>TOUR <span class="smcap">No. 1. Fare</span>, <i>8s.</i> <span class="smcap">Estate Tolls</span>, <i>1s.</i></h4>

<p>Well-appointed coaches, or other conveyances, leave the Hotel
(weather permitting) at about 9.30 a.m., for a visit to the
celebrated Gap of Dunloe and the grand tour of the Lakes. The route
lies along the northern side of the Lower Lake for about six miles,
when the exquisite mountain scenery comes in full view, rapidly
assuming more interesting features until "Arbutus" Cottage is
reached. Here the party must alight, and proceed on ponies, or on
foot, at discretion, through the Pass to Lord Brandon's Cottage, at
the head of the Upper Lake, where the boats will be in readiness.
Arrangements can be made with the Manager of the Hotel, before
starting, to provide ponies for <i>3s.</i> each to this point. Some
wonderful echoes are produced in various parts of the Pass.
Luncheon will be served, before entering the boat, on one of the
adjoining islands, after which the party will proceed by the Upper
Lake and Long Range to the Eagle's Nest Mountain. The boat will
then shoot the Rapids under the rustic Old Weir Bridge; stop a
short time at the "Meeting of the Waters"; pass through the Middle
Lake, and across the Lower Lake to "Sweet Innisfallen Island," to
enable the party to view the ruins of the old Abbey, Abbot's Grave,
and Bed of Honour; thence to Ross Castle, where the party will
resume their drive to the Hotel, which is usually reached about
5.30 p.m.</p>

<h4>TOUR <span class="smcap">No. 2. Fare</span>, <i>4s. 6d.</i> <span class="smcap">Estate Tolls</span>, <i>2s.</i></h4>

<p>The conveyances leave the Hotel about 10 a.m. for the drive through
Mr. H. A. Herbert's beautiful demesne. The ancient ruins of
Muckross Abbey are soon reached, and, after a short delay to
inspect them, the party proceed by the shore of the Middle Lake,
over Brickeen Bridge, pass the Colleen Bawn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> Rocks for Dinis
Island; thence, passing the Torc Mountain, to the Cottage and
Waterfall of Derrycunihy (Queen's Cottage), the property of the
Earl of Kenmare, where luncheon is usually served. Returning, the
party will pass under the tunnel on the Kenmare Road, and through
fine scenery by road, mountain, and lake to Torc Cascade, where, by
an easy footpath, fine views can be obtained of the Waterfall and
Lakes; thence to the Hotel, which is usually reached about 3 p.m.</p>

<h4>TOUR No. 3. <span class="smcap">Fare</span>, <i>4s. 6d.</i> <span class="smcap">Estate Tolls</span>, <i>1s.</i></h4>

<p>The conveyances leave the Hotel at about 9.30 a.m., passing through
the Earl of Kenmare's Deer Park to the Heights of Aghadoe,
obtaining grand views of the Lower Lake, Macgillicuddy's Reeks, and
Carran Tual (the highest mountain in Ireland), as also the ruins of
the round tower of Aghadoe Church, thence through the Earl of
Kenmare's beautiful West and Home Parks, which skirt the
north-eastern shores of the Lower Lake, round Ross Island, and to
the Hotel, which is usually reached about 2.30 p.m.</p></div>


<h3>KENMARE AND GLENGARRIFF.</h3>

<p>The coach drive from Killarney to Kenmare is over a fine broad mountain
road, and from Mulgrove Barrack, about half way, a splendid view of the
lake country can be obtained. Kenmare, as its name signifies in Irish,
is at the head of the sea or beautiful bay to which it gives its name on
the Roughty river. Sir William Pettie, in the seventeenth century,
founded the town on lands confiscated from the O'Sullivan More. It is a
market place of importance, and the Convent of the Poor Clares is famous
the world over for the beautiful lace made here. The town stands on the
highway between Killarney and Glengarriff, known as "The Prince of
Wales' route." The coach drives through the town past the Lansdowne
Arms' Hotel and into the beautiful spot which has been selected for the
new hotel belonging to the Southern Hotels Company. Already young groves
and plantations teem about the mansion, which is built on a natural
terrace overlooking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> the bay, and facing the high hills of Glenaroughty,
behind which the Red River rises, and the bare mountain slopes of
Mucksna.</p>

<p>No visitor should fail, if time permits, to visit the Convent of the
Poor Clares, and see the lace-makers at work. From Kenmare the train or
coach may be taken to Killarney.</p>

<p>To Glengarriff the coach runs by very beautiful scenery, terminating in
the lovely creek of the bay at <b>Eccles' Hotel</b> and by the fair height
where <b>Roche's Hotel</b> commands the view. From Glengarriff the coach may
be continued to Bantry, and the train then taken direct to Cork, along
the East Bandon line; or the road may be taken through the beautiful
Pass of Keimaneigh&mdash;the "Pass of the Deer"&mdash;and by the lovely lake of
Gougane Barra to Macroom. Here the Cork and Macroom Railway brings the
tourist back into the City of the Lee.</p>

<p>The road from Kenmare leads high out of the valley up the hill sides. We
command a good view of Kenmare Sound, and having passed under a number
of tunnels through the rock we cross the mearings into county Cork.</p>

<h4>Gougane Barra, Co. Cork.</h4>


<p>In a fair spot above the blue waters of the Bay of Bantry,
<b>Glengarriff</b>, as a health resort, vies with its charming young rival,
Parknasilla. Its climate, too, is softened by the nearness of the Gulf
Stream, and yew and arbutus, as well as tropical cryptogamia and Alpine
plants, overgrow every available spot along the sides of the rough
defile. It is come-at-able from Cork by train to Bantry and then coach,
or by coach from Killarney or Kenmare. Apart from the beauty of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
situation and the mildness of its climate, Glengarriff possesses
splendid facilities for sea bathing and boating. There is excellent
hotel accommodation both at Eccles', on the shore of the bay, and at
Roche's, in the midst of beautiful grounds, through which the Owvane, or
"fair river," flows, making on its way a wild cascade. The drive from
Glengarriff to Gougane Barra, through the Pass of Keimaneigh, "the path
of the deer," is one of the great excursions to be made. <b>Gougane
Barra</b>, the shrine of Saint Finbarr, is in the midst of a lonely lake
near the source of the Lee. It is still the scene of "patrons" on Saint
Finbarr's day, and Mass is celebrated in the open air in the middle of
the lake. There is good trout fishing in the Allua and other streams in
the Desmond Valley. Callaghan, the poet, has sung of it&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"There is a green island in lone Gougane Barra,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Where Allua of songs rushes forth as an arrow;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In deep-valleyed Desmond&mdash;a thousand wild fountains</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Come down to that lake, from their home in the mountains;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">There grows the wild ash, and a time-stricken willow</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Looks chidingly down on the mirth of the billow;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As, like some gay child, that sad monitor scorning,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">It lightly laughs back to the laugh of the morning.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And its zone of dark hills&mdash;oh! to see them all bright'ning;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When the tempest flings out its red banner of lightning;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the waters rush down, mid the thunders deep rattle,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Like clans from their hills at the voice of the battle;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And brightly the fire-crested billows are gleaming,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And wildly from Mullagh the eagles are screaming."...</span><br />
</p>

<p>The "green island" is a little over half an acre in extent. In its
centre is a quadrangle, with walls at parts fourteen feet thick, in
which are eight cells or cloisters rudely arched over. Within, on a
raised platform, is a large cross with five steps ascending to it. There
is a large flagstone here with an inscription, giving directions how
"the rounds" are to be performed on the vigil and forenoon of the feast
days of St. Finbarr and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> St. John the Baptist, to whom there is a
special cultos all over Munster. The road from Gougane runs through
Inchigeela and Ballingeary by a wild stretch of river inches, called the
Gearagh, to Macroom, where the old Castle and Convent are worth
visiting. In the latter the kindergarten system has been introduced with
great success. It is also here that the Gaelic Feis or Festival is held
for the locality, which contains a large percentage of Irish-speaking
people, including numbers of children. From Macroom train runs direct to
Cork. In the visitors' book at Inchigeela Hotel some vagabond rhymester
penned the following farewell:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sweet Inchigeela, fare thee well, to-morrow we depart</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">On Mrs. Brophy's outside car, for Gougane B. we start;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I add my mite of doggerel to all I have read here,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And put my X to all that's writ of this hotel's good cheer.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">O charming Inchigeela, were mine the poet's pen,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">How I would do the Longfellow, in praising rock and glen;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Among thy mountains, hills, and lakes, six happy days we passed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And sigh to think the day draws near that's doomed to be the last.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">We've climbed the rocky mountains, we've plodded o'er the plain,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">We've bid a wild defiance to the drizzling, drenching rain;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And yielding to the influence of your coquettish weather,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">We've grilled beneath the sunshine on thy "tick" infected heather.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">O lovely Inchigeela! O cosy Lake Hotel!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">O Hannah! best of waiting-maids, and civilest as well;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">O were I not so sleepy, a great deal more I'd say,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But I must grasp my pilgrim's staff and wend my onward way.</span><br />
</p>

<p>From <b>Cromwell's Bridge</b>, at Glengarriff, the road runs to Berehaven,
where there is an old Castle of the O'Sullivan's and some splendid
caves. Cromwell's Bridge, of which one arch only now remains intact, is
said to have been built here to facilitate the march of the Protector on
his return from Dunboy Castle, he having threatened, if the bridge was
not erected on his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> return, he would hang a man for every hour he was
delayed. <b>Bantry</b>, or the White Strand, is a thriving town, a pleasant
drive from Glengarriff. Here the French fleet, with Wolfe Tone on board,
purported landing in the winter of 1797; but, like the Armada, were
scattered by a hurricane. Bantry House, the residence of the
White-Hedges family, is beautifully situated on the side of the bay.</p>

<h4>Cromwell's Bridge, Glengarriff.</h4>


<p>The Cork and Bandon Railway from Bantry is connected with most of the
towns on the Cork coast. From Skibberreen, the famous fishing village of
<b>Baltimore</b> may be visited. The Piscatorial School is doing good work,
and is an enduring monument to the philanthropy of the Baroness
Burdett-Coutts. Innisherin Island, in Baltimore Harbour, was an old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
fortress of the O'Driscolls&mdash;and in particular of "Finnen O'Driscoll,
the Rover"&mdash;of whom it is told:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"The men of Clan-London brought over</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Their strong ships to make him a slave;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He met them by Mizen's wild headlands,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And the sharks gnaw their bones 'neath the wave."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Baltimore was sacked in the early seventeenth century by Algerine
pirates, and all the able-bodied inhabitants sold into slavery. These
pirates were finally put down by the intrepidity of the Commonwealth
seamen. Kinsale, also on the coast, is a remarkable old town; there
James II. landed on his ill-fated visit to Ireland. Bandon, beautifully
situated on the broad river of that name, was long the Derry of the
South. The memory of these "good old times" only now remains, and Bandon
is the centre of many successful industries.</p>

<p>The Grand Atlantic Tour&mdash;Caragh, Cahirciveen, Valencia, Waterville,
Parknasilla, Kenmare, &amp;c.</p>


<p>The beauty of Killarney is not without a rival, and that even "next
door" to it in its very own kingdom of Kerry. Leaving behind the
soft-swelling hills, deep-eyed lakes and dark mountains, we speed
southward and westward to other lakes and mountains kindred to what we
have already seen. It is for these lovely lands that the Gulf Stream
crosses the Atlantic to kiss, that we are making over the wide-armed
railway which clasps the most picturesque scenery in the country within
its embrace. Starting from Killarney for Valencia, we leave the train to
continue its journey northwards to Tralee, at Farranfore Junction. While
changing into the carriages for the south-west coast, where</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"The mountains kiss high heaven,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the waves clasp one another,"</span><br />
</p>

<p>one look round reveals the amphitheatre of hills. Westward, whither we
are going, the hills above<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span> Glenbeigh point our road to where the
Atlantic meets the shore. To the eastward, where the morn, in russet
mantle clad, walks o'er the dew, the line of far-piercing spears,
Mangerton, Torc, Glena, Toomies, and the Reeks extend. At Killorglin
(twenty-four miles rail), with a wide-spanning viaduct, we cross the
Laune, wending its way from the Lakes to Dingle Bay. Here the ruins of
an old Knights Templar Castle remain to remind us of the historic past.
For five-and-twenty miles from this place onward, the route runs over
the southern shore-line of Dingle Bay. Some five miles from Killorglin,
in a secluded nest of old trees beneath the mountains, lies <b>Caragh
Lake</b>.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Long, long ago, beyond the space</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of twice ten hundred years;</span><br />

<h4>Southern Hotel, Caragh Lake.</h4>


<p>And in their romances and love-songs, Caragh was tenderly mentioned, for
was it not here that Dermot sheltered Grania in the bowers of the
quicken-trees? All who have read the fine old Finnian romance, "The
Pursuit of Diarmuid and Grainne," which tells the iliad of their flight
across ancient Erin, will remember that here on the shores of Kerry he
met his enemies and discomfited them. In the mists westward from the
lake is the hill-summit, Seefin, where the disconsolate son of MacCool
sat. For long this little paradise has remained forgotten by
scenery-seeking men, but now that it is re-discovered, it will enthral
all comers. The lake, sheltered under the cloak of the hills, is six
miles long, and all around its coasts are things of beauty, green velvet
mosses, dark broom and heather-clad hills, with rowan trees interspersed
throughout. The grisly mountains are glistening with silver
threads&mdash;small streams that hasten to see themselves reflected in the
lake. Far from the busy haunts of men, in a sleepy hollow only five
minutes' walk from the railway station, the <b>Southern Hotel</b><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span> Company
has secured a delightful site for their fine hotel. If nature has done
great things for Caragh, "filthy lucre," too, has done much, and here is
everything to help the invalid, the sportsman, or "the common or garden"
tourist to take advantage of the charming pleasure and health resort.
For the fisherman there are almost endless opportunities. There is
excellent salmon and trout fishing in the Caragh Lake, and also in the
Caragh, Carahbeg, Ougarriv, and Meelagh Rivers, while within easy reach
are Lakes Acoose, Cloon, Coomlonkir, Oulagh, Loughnakirkna, Corravoula,
and Nabrackdarrig, all of which would gladden the heart of old Izaac
Walton. Over twenty-five thousand acres of the best shooting in Kerry is
reserved for the use of guests. It comprises principally grouse,
woodcock, snipe, duck, wild goose, and plover. Both banks of the Caragh
River, which is carefully preserved, have also been secured. <b>Dooks</b>, in
the vicinity, has been selected for an excellent nine-hole golf course,
of which guests, as honorary members, are entitled to take advantage. A
flag-station on the railway brings the links within easy walking
distance. The grand strand along the shore gives every opportunity of
bathing. Across the beautiful Dingle Bay rises Mount Brandon (3,127
feet), and Dunmore Head, out at the edge of the ocean, has the Blasket
Islands scattered around its coast, the treacherous rocks of which were
so fatal to the Spanish Armada. By car from the hotel to Blackstones
Bridge, returning by boat through the lake, is a short tour of many
attractions. Beneath, at one side, lie the bright waters of the bay; on
the other the dark waters of the lake. The Killorglin road is reached
about a mile from Acoose Lake, and then following the declivity by a
mountain stream, we get a good view of Gort-na-gloran Mountain, on the
east of the lake, and see in the distance the fishing hamlet of Glencar,
with the Glencar Hotel high up on pasture ground, surrounded by a cordon
of green fir trees. Except in the Swiss valleys<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span> and parts of Norway,
there is no scenery in Europe to compare with an inland route from
Caragh to Parknasilla. It lies across the mountains</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Where the wandering water gushes</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">In the hills above Glencar;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In pools among the rushes,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">That scarce could bathe a star,"</span><br />
</p>

<p>through wild scenery between the gorges of the mountains, and into
Ballaghbeama Pass. Beneath, in a winding valley, lies Lough Brin,
turning from which we come into the valley of the Eskdhu, or Blackwater,
and follow it amid the beeches until it falls into the sea.</p>

<h4>Pass of Ballaghbeama.</h4>


<p>Leaving Caragh Lake, the railway line follows the flow of the river, the
next station being <b>Glenbeigh</b>, where there is a growing watering-place.
The strand is particularly fine, extending over two miles. There is a
good hotel, with golf links, beside plenty of fishing and boating.
<b>Coomasaharn</b>&mdash;the wonderful lake in the vicinity&mdash;it has been correctly
said is surrounded by precipices more awful than anything to be found
nearer home than the Alps or Pyrenees&mdash;clinging to the mountain side, at
a height of several hundred feet above the sea, with here a cutting or
embankment, and there a mountain gorge, in which a lovely waterfall is
almost lost to sight in a labyrinth of foliage.</p>

<p><b>Mountain Stage</b> and <b>Kells</b> are passed, and the train glides down an
incline to Cahirciveen and Valentia Harbour. <b>Cahirciveen</b>, the
birthplace of Daniel O'Connell, is the most westerly town in the three
kingdoms. It lies with its back up against the Iveragh Mountains, and
facing the blue waters of Dingle Bay. Only since the road was cut across
the hills to Valentia in later years has it come to be of importance. In
1803 there were only fifteen houses here, and the beginning of its
uprise in the world was when O'Connell got it made a market town. But in
legends<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span> of the past it is a place of fame, and received its name from
Sive, one of the beautiful daughters of the great monarch, Owen More.
<b>Carhan House</b>, where the Liberator spent his childhood (but was not
actually born, as alleged), the ruins of which now only remain, may be
seen a short distance outside the town.</p>

<h4>On the Coast near Glenbeigh.</h4>


<p>Two charming fishing harbours under Knocktubber Mountain are worth
seeing, Councroum, "the Haven's Bend," and Coonana, which is called
after the woman who bore the great Finn. Here, the mighty fighter of the
old days, "Conn of the Hundred Battles," fought no less than thirteen of
his fields, and three pre-historic forts remain to bear testimony to the
past&mdash;Cahir-na-cahal, Cahirgal, and Castlequinn.</p>

<p>Ballycarbery's ruined castle, too, deserves attention. In ancient times
it was the fortress of Carbery O'Shea, whose tide-swept tomb is still to
be seen. Then it passed into the hands of Owen More's descendants, and
from them to the O'Connells. When the Spaniards sent their "ale" over to
Erin, and the Kerry women borrowed one another's cloaks to go to Spain
to sell eggs and dulisc, Ballycarbery, commanding the harbour's mouth,
was a place frequented by mariners and merchantmen from many a Spanish
port. There is a story of Morgan of the Wine and a Spanish Captain worth
re-telling. Two O'Connells lived in Ballycarbery together, one brother,
Shawn, occupying the lower portion, and the other, Morgan, living in the
upper apartments. Both at the same moment invited a Spanish captain, who
had come into the port, to dine with them. The foreigner, embarrassed by
their hospitality, and not wishing to show an undue preference&mdash;as
neither brother would give way&mdash;agreed to give his company to whichever
gentleman had his repast cooked first. The brothers repaired with speed
to the castle, and Morgan was chagrined when he had mounted to his
rooms, to find that Shawn had barricaded the entrance behind him, to
prevent his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span> servants from drawing water to cook the dinner. But he
was not to be foiled, for, broaching a cask of wine, he cooked in it
what he wanted, and as his dinner was first prepared, the Spaniard and
his brother Shawn were his guests! In the wars of the Commonwealth the
castle was reduced. <b>Derriana Lake</b>, in the bed of the mountains&mdash;with
wisps of mist on its further shores&mdash;is like a dream picture. The fair
isle floating in its centre is freighted down with oak and arbutus trees
standing out in relief against the mountain, and reflected in the
mirror-faced waters. The coloured setting of the surroundings is
exquisite. The cliffs bristle crest high with rigid firs, the young oak
copse is entangled with an undergrowth of guelder rose, and in the
sedges near the heron-frequented reeds, white water lilies open their
wonderful eyes. Close by, <b>Cloonaghlin Lake</b>, when it is dark with
mountain shadows and frowning clouds, is sufficiently desolate to awe
the least susceptible, but when auspiciously the sky is brightened, we
feel&mdash;</p>

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A pleasant thing it is for the</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Eyes to behold the sun."</span><br />
</p>

<p>The shadows recede into the depths of the water or the hollows of the
hills, the many colours of the trees show themselves; and song-birds
begin anew their music, as though a great hawk had been near, and had
passed them by scathless.</p>


<h3>VALENCIA ISLAND</h3>

<p>May truly be termed the "Next parish to America," and should be visited
for its noble cliffs, wild headlands, and wonderful jungle of fuschia
trees. From Valencia Harbour a ferry, manned for upwards of a century by
the O'Neills, brings passengers and mails across to Knightstown, the
principal village, and a busy port of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> industry during the fishing
season. Glenleam, the Knight of Kerry's residence&mdash;about one mile
inland&mdash;is surrounded by beautiful gardens, where, besides arbutus and
myrtle, many tropical exotics thrive. The fuschias form a thick glade,
and the trunks of several of them almost defy the ordinary axe or saw.
There are on the island, besides holy wells, a number of soutterains and
cairns, that</p>

<p>Irish is freely spoken on the island, and if properly introduced, the
visitor may be able to hear many old stories of Finn and his companions,
the Gabawn Saior, and other heroes of the peasants' heart. Thick as
mists at morn legends hover about the island, and beyond the great Slate
quarries may be seen many caves of great interest. There is a tradition
on the island that St. Vincent Ferrar landed there. The harbour offers a
deep and sheltered anchorage, and was formerly much frequented by
smugglers, whose cave is still shown. Paul Jones often put in here, and
on one occasion pressed into his service a number of fishermen, whom he
took from the neighbouring fishing grounds. None of them returned except
one, who had long been imprisoned in France, but he came home "with a
stocking full of doubloons," and his children's children are still known
as "The Paul Jones's."</p>

<p>At <b>Brayhead</b>,</p>

<p class='center'>
"Where the broad ocean leans against the land,"
</p>

<p>there is a splendid view from nearly eight hundred feet above the sea.
The rocks around the coast, encircled with white foam, make a beautiful
contrast to the grey and emerald and gold of the sandy coves and green
hills.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<h4>Cliffs at Valencia.</h4>

<p>Dolus and Bolus Heads reach far into the ocean. The <b>Skelligs</b>, "the
most western of Christ's fortresses in the ancient world," raise their
heads to the south, while northwards the Great Blasket, a mountainous
island, and its eleven brothers, with Innisvic Killane, may be seen. On
the 10th September, 1588, the Armada ship, <i>Our Lady of the Rosary</i>, of
1,000 tons, was wrecked in the Blasket Sound; among the many who
perished was the Prince of Askule, natural son to King Philip of Spain.
Around the coast line there have been many wrecks, and not a few are the
pathetic stories still told of them on the island.</p>

<p>The last wreck of importance gave another opportunity for the intrepid
islanders to show what stern stuff they were made of. Under the
captaincy of Mr. Alexander O'Driscoll, the volunteers put off to the
wreck, and despite of a sea running high, and the buffeting of a great
storm, saved the lives of the crew, and rendered full salvage. While on
the island, a visit should be paid to the Anglo-American Cable Company's
Station, care being taken beforehand to go through the formality of
applying to the Managing Director (26, Old Bond-street, London, E.C.)
for an order. Every facility is extended by the courteous local
officials.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE SKELLIGS&mdash;ST. MICHAEL'S ROCK.</h3>

<p>From Valencia, or from across the channel at Portmagee, where there is a
thriving fish-curing industry, the Skelligs can be reached in favourable
weather. Standing high above the green billows that encircle them with
collars of white foam, they repay every trouble taken to inspect them.
The <b>Little Skellig</b>, a fantastic rock, with a great arch like a flying
buttress under which for centuries the seas have churned deep, is almost
inaccessible. It is a great breeding ground for gannet, with which,
during the breeding season, its sides are white as the waves below.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/img195.jpg" alt="Skellig" title="Skellig" /></div>

<h4>Skellig.</h4>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>So unused are these magnificent birds to being disturbed by intruders
that even when within oar's length of them, they remain passive and
unscared. The <b>Great Skellig</b> swings high its cliffs seven hundred feet
above the water. Clinging to the ridge of its impressive rocks "like
swallows' nests" are the round roofs of the beehive cells which of old
formed a citadel of Christianity. To Saint Michael the Archangel,
guardian against all the powers of darkness, the isle is dedicated. Its
history is of old date, for here Milesius buried the beloved son, Ir,
that the thieving waters robbed of his soul. Here "the slanting,
full-sailing ships" of Daire, on their way to the great battle of Ventry
Harbour, paused in their march along the deep. Here, too, in recording
times, was the great hero-king of the Norse, Olaf Iryggveson, baptized.</p>

<p>A little cove, deep in the recess of a cavern, makes a landing stage,
only to be attempted at favourable times. An easy path leads halfway
round the island; then, mounting a flight of steps, the visitor beholds,
spread before him, a green valley, the one patch of richness on the
desolate rock. This is Christ's Saddle, from which, with reverent
hearts, the "Way of the Cross" may be traversed, ending in the heart of
Skellig-Michael. Each of the fourteen Stations have descriptive Gaelic
names, such as "The Stone of Pain," where our Saviour falls the first
time; "The Rock of the Woman's Piercing Caoine," where His Mother and
the Holy Women have met. Lonely and deserted, none should enter these
hallowed places but with feelings of reverence.</p>


<h3>WATERVILLE.</h3>

<p>The morning stillness, broken by the clear blast of the postillion's
horn, reminds the visitor lingering lovingly over the shores at
Cahirciveen that the coach for the coast tour is ready. With a crack of
the whip<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span> that would do credit to Will Goldfinch, in the coaching days
of old, the driver urges on his team, and the blooded four-in-hand cut
their way clear of the town. The tour along the Atlantic between
Cahirciveen and Kenmare is nearly fifty miles, and passes through the
most diversified country. The eleven miles as far as Waterville is first
inland, passing through dreary stretches of moorland, where the small
black Kerry cattle manage to thrive, until Ballinskelligs Bay suddenly
comes in sight. Bolus Head reaches out its great arm into the sea, to
shelter the Bay from the winds. At one side may be seen the little town
of Ballinskelligs, with its white Cable Station; and in at the head of
the waters, beyond where the Inny river joins the sea, Waterville
spreads itself out around the long shore. Here it lies on the little
streak of land which protects Lough Currane from the embrace of the
ocean. Coming down the hill, out of the town, the delusion is that this
great fresh-water lake is but itself a bay, the mouth of which is
concealed from view, but not so, for its waters run clear and fresh, and
as fishful as the Erne. It is the best free fishing lake in Ireland.
Just outside Waterville the Commercial Cable Company (Mackay-Bennett
system) have their extensive offices.</p>

<h4>Kilkenny CastleSouthern Hotel, Waterville.</h4>

<p>The road leads across the Inny, and we enter the little town by the
pleasantly-situated Butler Arms Hotel. On going further, fronting the
shore line, we pass the Bay View Hotel, and, following a bend in the
hill, come suddenly in view of the beautiful Lough Currane, beside
which, in the midst of plantations, more like a home than a
well-equipped hostelry, which it is, the <b>Southern Hotel</b> is built.
Lough Currane is eight miles in circumference, and its shores are
fretted with thousands of inlets. Through the windows of the Hotel, a
charming view is had of the mountains which encircle the lake. On one
side green slopes and pleasantly wooded heights meet the eye, and on the
other, old familiar grey-faced mountains, with their heads raised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span> on
high among the clouds, shining, changing, and fading in the silver
mists. The surface of the lake, calm-faced and deep-welled, here and
there lifts up to be admired beautiful islands. Here a saint made his
temporal home, and in Church Island is the beehive cell where St. Finian
prayed, "in whose orisons were all our sins remembered." The ruins of
the sixth century church deserve the attention of the antiquary. Away at
the head of Lough Currane is Coppal, where sea trout and small brown
trout abound. It, too, has charms all its own, in parts wild and
untamed, but again, calm as the race of a sleeping child. Full
information as to the flies suitable for the lake, and the places well
to troll, may be had from the best known angler in Kerry, Teigue
M'Carthy. Like Sir Roger de Coverley's friend, Will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span> Wimble, he can tie
a fly "to a miracle," and he is an enthusiastic devotee of the "gentle
art." Besides the attractions for fishermen, there are thousands of
acres of shooting in the vicinity. There is plenty of opportunity and
accommodation for bathing by the bay, and a new Golf Links, laid out
under the best professional<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span> advice, affords a further source of
healthful amusement. Over the hills from Waterville the pre-historic
remains of Staigue Fort may be visited. It is the best example of
cyclopean stone forts that remains in Ireland, and by authoritative
antiquaries is said to be at least 2,000 years old.</p>

<h3>EXCURSIONS IN THE VICINITY OF WATERVILLE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Tour</span> 1.&mdash;The conveyance will leave the Hotel at 11 a.m. for a
drive to Derrynane, the historic home of the Liberator, On reaching
Coomakista Pass&mdash;the highest point of the road&mdash;a gradual descent brings
the party to Derrynane House, and further on to Derrynane Hotel, close
to the remains of the old Abbey. Those who wish to walk can get off the
car at Coomakista, and walk one and-a-half miles to Lord Dunraven's
cottage, where they can meet the cars. The path winds along the shore of
Derrynane Bay, and well repays those who follow it on their way to the
Abbey, The party can lunch at Derrynane Hotel, and may return by the
path, and meet the car at Coomakista, or drive the whole way back to
Waterville. Fare for four persons, <i>12s.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tour</span> 2.&mdash;The conveyance will leave the Hotel at 11 a.m., and
drive along the northern shore of Lough Currane. Crossing the Coomeragh
by the Ivy Bridge, the road leads us as far as Isknamaclery Lake. At
this point a unique view is obtained of Isknamaclery Lake and Lough
Nabrackderrag on the right, and Loughs Namona and Cloonaghlin on the
left. The party can have the option of proceeding on foot to Derriana
Lake, or returning and driving along the Coomeragh to Derriana Lodge,
and from thence returning to Waterville, or they can cross the Dromad
Hills, and return by the river Inny. Fare for four persons, <i>12s.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tour</span> 3.&mdash;The conveyance leaves the Hotel at 11 a.m. for Saint
Finan's Glen. Before entering the Glen, a fine view is obtained of the
Iveragh Mountains, and even the M'Gillicuddy Reeks, and later, the Lemon
Rock and the Skelligs. After luncheon in the Glen, the party will return
by Bolus Head, visiting the old Abbey of Saint Michael's and
Ballinskellias Castle, and (with the permission of the Superintendent)
the Atlantic Cable Station. For sea and mountain combined this view
cannot be surpassed. Fare for four persons, <i>16s.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tour</span> No. 4.&mdash;The conveyance will leave the Hotel at about 11
a.m., for the remarkable fort of Staigue-an-or. The route lies along the
southern shore of Lough Currane for about six miles, (passing the
Waterfall) as far as Isknagahenny (Coppal) Lake, and good views are
obtained of both lakes. At Isknagahenny Lake the party alights, and
proceeds on foot for about four miles to the fort. When the highest
point of the ascent is reached, a magnificent view is obtained of
Kenmare river and the islands off the coast of Beara Peninsula. The
descent to the foot is easy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span> After luncheon the party may return either
by West Cove and Derrynane to Waterville, or again ascend the mountain
and return by Lake Road. Fare for four persons, <i>16s.</i></p>

<p>Shorter excursions can be arranged.</p>

<p>The coach road from Waterville, following the outskirts of
Ballinskelligs Bay, insinuates itself up a dizzy height. Looking
backwards, Waterville, "standing with reluctant feet" between the sea
and the lake, seems to wonder which is more bewitching. Forging ahead
through the mountain gaps, we pass under <b>Coomakiska</b>, 1,500 feet, and
<b>Beenarourke</b>, 1,000 feet above the sea level. Clearing the gates of the
mountains,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span> we come into the open highlands above <b>Derrynane</b>, watching
out from its post over the sea. Truly the home for a chief. Here
O'Connell spent his happiest days, within the roar of the Atlantic
billows, but far from the turmoil and stress of the great agitation in
which his figure looms large as a giant form. Here his hospitable door
flew open wide to the passing stranger, and across the hills, with the
fleet-footed hound, he enjoyed the most delightful of sports, coursing!
Several interesting relics of the Liberator are shown at the house of
his descendant, the present proprietor. The ruins of <b>Derrynane Abbey</b>,
in the vicinity of O'Connell's home, stand on a small peninsula, at some
seasons transformed into an island by the divorcing rush of the high
tides. It was a foundation of the monks of St. Finbarr, called
Aghermore, such a place as that described in the life of St. Brendan,
who, first of the old-world mariners, discovered the great Land of the
West.</p>

<p>On the road beneath Crohan, a mile north from Coad Church is St.
Kiernan's Cell, eaten into the face of the sheer rock. In this district
formerly the mines were worked and copper smelted. As the road winds
along we can see Staigue-an-or, with its cyclopean mounds, lying low and
dwarfed on the hillside. By the high mountains, where the coach-horn
sounds sweet and awakens echoes, the road comes down into the lowlands,
and from the bridge is seen beautiful landscape, with <b>Sneem</b> spread out

<p>Here in the demesne lands of a Bishop's Old Palace, the <b>Southern Hotel</b>
new palace has been built. The green turf of its lawn extends down to
the water's edge. It is a land of arbutus and myrtle, of glades laden
with the pink and white blossoms of oleander and rhododendron, and thick
with bells of fuschias, the fair daffodils of Shakespeare and Herrick,
that fade away too soon:</p>

<p>Derreen, away in the lap of the landscape, found favour of Froude, and
at Kilmackilloge he found material for his novel. The beautiful
<b>Garinish</b> Island is like a little paradise, lost in a land where all is
lovely. Around the shores, and in the sandy caves, the beautiful seals
cluster, and at times are so tame as to answer the shrill whistle of the
boatman, and show their lovely forms on the water's surface near at
hand. We live in sceptical times, when</p>

<p>But still here, along the old-world shores, where daylight dies, the

and there is none more interesting than that which teaches the fishermen
to regard these beautiful-eyed, plaintive-voiced creatures with
tenderness. The souls of the dead, drowned at sea, who die out of
friendship with God, go into the bodies of the seals, and there through
the ages await the Trump of the Archangel to call them before the Great

<h4>Southern Hotel, Parknasilla.</h4>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>"Parknasilla is situated on the northern shore of Kenmare Bay, a bay
rich in beauty, and with singularly-indented coast lines. Its
well-sheltered position amidst a number of islets, thickly wooded down
to the water's edge, has endowed it with unique advantages. This
protective area gives to Parknasilla claims of a special character, and
prevents the access to it of all winds except those coming from the
warmer points, viz., south and south-west; these winds, before reaching
the southern coast of Ireland, having travelled over the Gulf Stream,
and being thus subjected to its moderating and balmy influence. We all
recognise what elevation of the land will do for any place, particularly
if it shelters that place from winds blowing from the cold quarters.
Thus, mountain protection is of supreme importance in the choice of a
health resort, more especially in the winter and spring seasons of the
year. In this regard Parknasilla is exceptionally favoured, a
mountainous range closely guarding and protecting it from the northerly
and easterly winds. The combination of mountain, wood, and water gives a
special charm to this locality; and a convincing evidence of the
mildness of the winter and early spring here is the forward character of
the vegetation, the early budding of the trees, shrubs, and flowers&mdash;all
bearing testimony to the mildness of the climate. Temperature rapidly
tells its tale on the vegetable world, and there can be no more
reassuring proof of the equable and balmy character of the climate of a
district than the early growth of flowering shrubs, plants, and table
produce. The position of this favoured and sheltered sea inlet upon the
isothermal map shows it to have a mean annual temperature of 52 degrees,
being similar in this regard to its neighbour, Glengarriff, and
registering a higher mean annual temperature than Ventnor or Torquay.
The mildness of the climate in the earlier spring months is of such a
character that exercise can be freely partaken of in the open air daily,
without risk of chill; and this to the invalid is of paramount
importance. No record has, as yet, been regularly taken of the daily
sunshine, or of the rainfall, but so far as could be ascertained, the
rainfall does not appear to be excessive. To sufferers from chronic or
recurrent affections of the respiratory organs, Parknasilla, in the
winter and early spring months, would appear to be indicated as a most
desirable place of residence. I have had the advantage of two recent
visits to this district, and feel convinced that, when it becomes better
known, Parknasilla will prove a veritable haven of health and rest to
the chronic invalid and the convalescent, as well as a delightful
retreat to the busy man of the 'world's mart,' who may need a temporary
repose from the worries and cares of daily life. Parknasilla is about a
two hours' drive or thereabouts from Kenmare, the drive being one of
exceptional beauty and interest."&mdash;<i>Dublin Journal of Medical Science</i>,

<p>The road to Kenmare lies high above the sea. Ardgroom is hiding under
the Caha mountains, with Glenbeg Lake behind, in the little valley.
Beneath Derrenamackan the lashing seas wage perpetual warfare against
the rocks. By the Eskdhu, or Blackwater Bridge, amid the dense foliage
of the trees, a waterfall bleats from the thicket with plaintive murmur.
Then it breaks itself free, and amid rocks, and briars, and tangled
underwood, rushes wildly towards the sea. Between us and the ocean is
Dromore Castle, the residence of one of the heads of a sept of the
O'Mahony clan. In the demesne are the ruins of Cappacross, a stronghold
of the O'Sullivans. Dunkerron Castle, on the shore, gives its name to

<p>Clare County possesses the finest cliff scenery in Ireland. From
Limerick or Galway the county may be explored. On the journey by rail
from Limerick, beyond Long Pavement, we come on a fine view of Cratloe
woods. An ancient saint referred to Cratloe as "a pleasant seclusion
from sin"; but in later times it became a haunt of rapparees, and its
thick foliage provided what Spenser would call "a meet house for
rebels." In later times Freney, a noted highwayman, whose exploits
delighted the Irish peasant, here found a refuge. Bunratty Castle was a
strong place in feudal times. Here Rinuccini, the Papal Legate to
Ireland in 1641, sojourned, and his papers contain many references to
the picturesqueness of the surrounding country, and its herds of wild
deer. Between Newmarket and Ardsollus is Dromoland, the seat of Lord
Inchiquin, and the birthplace of William Smith O'Brien, the aristocratic
leader of the revolutionists of 1848. Crossing the Ardsollus river, we
are near Quin Abbey, an old Franciscan Priory, and Clare Castle, which
took its name from an old watch tower in the river Fergus. <b>Ennis</b> is
the chief town in the County Clare. It is more quaint than important. It
is pleasantly placed on the river Fergus, and is a clean town, doing a
thriving business with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span> country. The principal monument in the
town is to Daniel O'Connell, who was returned for Clare in the famous
election of 1828. The ashes of the controversy that raged around
O'Connell in his lifetime are long since dead, and if one wanted proof
of this it is in the recent biography of the great agitator which
appears in the "Heroes of the Nation" series. In that, the famous Clare
election is treated with true historic discrimination by the writer, who
compares the bravery of the Clare peasants at Ennis to the gallant
Covenanters standing up against Claverhouse's Dragoons at Bothwell
Bridge. From Ennis, by car and light railway, Ennistymon, Lehinch,
Lisdoonvarna, and Ballyvaughan may be reached. At Ennistymon there is a
splendid cascade on the Innagh river. <b>Lisdoonvarna</b> possesses the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
best known Spa in Ireland. It is come-at-able from Milltown-Malbay or
Ennistymon. Its friends have called it "The Cheltenham of Ireland." It
cannot be pretended that the immediate scenery is attractive, but there
are many interesting drives in the vicinity. The hotels and lodgings are
good. The sixth century Church of Saint Cronan, pleasantly placed in an
ash-grove, will give those of an antiquarian taste opportunity of
beguiling their time during a stay at the beneficial chalybeate and
sulphurous springs. The drives from Lisdoonvarna may include tours to
Ballyvaughan and the Cliffs of Moher. The drive by Black Head, the
north-eastern promontory of county Clare, gives one a fine view as far
north as the Arran; then we approach Ballyvaughan, in Galway Bay, an
out-of-the-way old world village. Its approach is by a spiral hill, over
two miles in length, called "The Corkscrew-road." The sides of the stony
hills are interspersed with the most delicate maiden-hair fern, growing
wild. There are two small but neat hotels in Ballyvaughan. From this
little town Galway might be visited by steamer and the Arran Isles by
hooker. <b>Kilkee</b> is admittedly the best bathing-place in these islands.
It is dashed into with the full force of the Atlantic, but with the
countless nooks fitted into the rocky coast-line, there are numbers of
sandy strands suitable for bathing. Here, situated in the very outpost
of the West of Ireland, it is as up-to-date and as go-a-head as some of
its more fashionable rivals, while in natural advantages it excels them
all. It is easy of access by land and sea. The town is protected by a
long reef of rock, called "Duggerna." The cliff scenery is very
beautiful. The spots to visit are The Puffing Hole, Saint Senanus' Holy
Well, Bishop's Island, with its beehive cells and Green Rock. A tour to
Loophead will bring one in sight of a long line of cliff scenery.
<b>Lehinch</b> and Liscanor Bay promise to become the best patronised golf
links in Ireland. Right in front<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span> of the little town is a splendid
strand, and local enterprise has been auxiliary to nature in making the
spot attractive. <b>Spanish Point</b> also possesses splendid strands, where
sea-bathing may be enjoyed with safety. Two miles away is
<b>Milltown-Malbay</b>. The town is business-like, and the coast-line in the
vicinity is associated with weird tales of wreckers; there some of the
unfortunate Spaniards came to grief in 1588. The <b>Cliffs of Moher</b> may
be visited from Milltown, Lehinch, or Lisdoonvarna. Going up the road
from Lehinch to <b>Liscanor</b> we pass a Holy Well dedicated to Saint
Brigid. The only cliff scenery in the British Isles to compare with that
of Moher is at the Orkney islands. They make a magnificent embroidery
into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span> the red sandstone along the coast-line for four miles, rising in
heights varying from 440 to 700 feet. From their height on a clear day
the distant Isles of Arran may be seen, and the whole surroundings make
as gorgeous a seascape as is to be found anywhere in the world. An
observer will readily recognise that the quaint craft which the
fishermen still use in the vicinity of Moher, as indeed elsewhere in
Clare, is the ancient coracle. <b>Kilrush</b>, on the Lower Shannon, is
chiefly of interest to the antiquary. It can be reached from Limerick,
by the Shannon, as pointed out already, and from Kilkee by Rail. By a
ferry from a slip at the foot of the little town, the holy island,
Scattery, the shrine of Saint Senanus, may be reached. The Round Tower
is in good preservation, and the remains of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span> Seven Churches can
still be traced. Saint Senanus' bed is still pointed out. No peasant
woman who wishes to be a mother will ever enter this hallowed spot. The
legend of Saint Senanus is similar to that of Saint Kevin. He was
haunted by the love of a woman from whom he flew. Thomas Moore in verse
tells us the hard-heartedness of both the anchorites:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Oh! haste, and leave this sacred isle,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Unholy bark, e'er morning smile,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For on thy deck, though dark it be,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">A female form I see.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And I have sworn this sainted sod</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Shall ne'er by woman's feet be trod."</span><br />

<h2>Galway and District.</h2>


<p>Leaving the County Clare by rail we cross into Galway, between Crusheen
and Tubber. Beyond the marshy country on the right, away in the
woodlands, nestles Loughcootra Castle. The great lake from which the
place takes its name covers eight square miles. The hundreds of islets
here scattered about its surface are the homes of thousands of herons.
The country people have a belief that this bird is a messenger of good
omen, and never interfere with it or its young. There is a beautiful
legend in Irish of a heron which visited St. Columba, at Iona, a
traveller from his own country. This story is recorded in the
interesting life of the saint written in the seventh century by Adamnan,
one of his successors; a beautiful version in English tells of the saint
rising at dawn of day after a dream of the coming of the bird:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"He looked out over the dreary moor,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Over the hill so bleak and hoar&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'A bird from the land I revisit no more</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Has come to visit me,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Dear Innisfail from thy fragrant shore&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Land of my own I shall see no more&mdash;</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 3em;">Across the driving sea.'</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Then he left his prayer, and 'Brother,' he said,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Take to thee corn, and oil, and bread,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A bird has alit&mdash;half frozen, half dead&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Upon our southern strand.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Then warm him and feed him with gentle care,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And chafe his wing's and anoint him there,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">He comes from my own loved land&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">From my own loved land,' and the old Saint wept;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But the Monk arose, while the others slept,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And warmed the heron, and fed and kept</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The bird for a day and night.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So Columb feeling, though far away,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For Ireland's soil&mdash;like the Gael to-day&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">One favour in heaven's sight."</span><br />
</p>

<p>The magnificent residence was designed and erected similarly to East
Comer Castle (by Nash, who remodelled Windsor) for Lord Gort, the head
of the Vereker family, at a cost of &pound;70,000. The black hand of the
famine of 1847 fed on this property, like many another in Ireland, and
it passed from its owners under the Encumbered Estates Act. Cove Park,
the residence of Lady Gregory, is just outside Gort. Her Ladyship has
found a way to the hearts of the country people by her sympathy with the
Irish language movement. Her volume, "Mr. Gregory's Letter Box," is a
valuable contribution to the history of Ireland in the first three
decades of the nineteenth century. Sir William Gregory's Memoirs it is
that contain the circumstantial version of the Cabinet scandal, in which
the name of the Hon. Mrs. Norton (George Meredith's "Diana of the
Crossways") figures. The story of the leakage of the State secret is as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"When Sir Robert Peel determined to repeal the Corn Laws he
consulted a portion of his Cabinet. They were Sidney Herbert, Lord
Lincoln, Sir Jas. Graham, and Lord Aberdeen, all of whom determined
that the repeal of the Corn Laws should be kept a profound secret
until the whole of the Cabinet had assembled. That same evening
Sidney Herbert dined <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with Mrs. Norton, the well-known
object of his attachment, and with whom he was infatuated. Before
dinner was over she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span> wormed out of him the secret of the Cabinet.
After dinner she pretended to go to see a sick friend for a short
time, and returned in half-an-hour. In the meantime she had taken a
cab and driven down to the <i>Times</i> Office, and saw Barnes, the
Editor, and told him the Government were going to repeal the Corn
Laws. Barnes said to her, "If you have no proof I shall not detain
you, but if you have you shall have &pound;500." She gave him the chapter
and verse, and returned to poor Sidney Herbert with the cheque in
her pocket. The next day the announcement was made in the <i>Times</i>
which astounded all England. This was on the 5th December, 1845.
The other papers disbelieved it. Lord Derby and the Duke of
Richmond left the Government."</p></div>

<p>In the heart of a stony country beset with high fences and rough copple
stones, stands the little town of <b>Gort</b>, The military stationed there
now add to its importance. Kilmacduagh, at the base of the Burren Hills,
contains a church (seventh century) of St. Colman, the Blue-eyed, and a
Round Tower leaning out of the perpendicular. In pre-historic times all
this country side at the foot of Burren, from Gort to Loughrea, and for
miles apart, is said to have been the favourite hunting-ground of Queen
Maev. <b>Kinvara</b>, away on an inlet of Galway Bay, is a fishing village,
and the locality is celebrated for the "succulent oysters"&mdash;which in the
season are to be found in every restaurant in Dublin. The antiquary will
find his way easily to Corcomroe Abbey&mdash;the church is still in a good
state of preservation. Donald More O'Brien, King of Limerick, is
commonly believed to have built it in the twelfth century. It
subsequently became subject to Furness, in Lancashire. Donough O'Brien,
King of Thomond&mdash;killed in battle in 1267&mdash;is buried here; his monument
discloses the rude magnificence of his attire. The effigy is looked upon
by scientists as an example of the attire of an Irish King of the
thirteenth century.</p>

<p><b>Athenry</b>, as its name, the "Ford of the Kings," signifies, and its
ruins testify, was of old a place of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span> renown. The tower is entered by a
small gate tower; before it stands the quaint market cross, on one side
is the Virgin and Child, on the other the figure of the Crucified. The
base is relieved with deer and wolf hounds, and at the corner an angel
holds a scroll, the legend of which is defaced. The Franciscan Priory
(1464), despite the attempt to modernise it, has still two thirteenth
century windows, and the south transept has the remains of a very
beautiful window. The Dominican Priory is said to have been erected at
the personal request of St. Dominick in 1241. So late as 1644 it was the
seat of a university acknowledged by Rome.</p>

<p><b>Tuam</b> is now of little importance. It is to ecclesiastics, however, of
interest, as the centre of an Archiepiscopal See. The statue to John
MacHale is worth seeing. He was well known in the first part of the
nineteenth century as "John of Tuam." An uncompromising Ultramontane, he
translated Homer into Gaelic, and O'Connell in one of his speeches
called this great patriot bishop "The Lion of the Fold of Judah." The
ancient cross in the square is a good specimen of the Irish stone
crosses.</p>

<p><b>Galway</b> still possesses the evidence of its former greatness. To-day it
is simply an old world city in the midst of a sporting county. Of old it
was a strong-walled town, ever on the alert against alarm and foray,
with its harbour crowded with the warships of Spain and the merchantmen
of many a foreign port. There is a famous map of the city, dating back
to 1651, when the then Lord Deputy Clanricarde pledged the town to the
Duke of Lorraine. It shows a walled-in town with fourteen gates, each
guarded by a watch-tower.</p>

<p class='center'><i>Photo&mdash;Lawrence, Dublin.</i></p>

<h4>At Galway.</h4>


<p>In the twelfth century, when De Burgo conquered O'Connor, he made Galway
the citadel of his western possessions. During the next century there
gathered into the prosperous town from far and near adventurers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span> and
merchants&mdash;the Blakes and the Bodkins, the Lynches, the Morrises, the
Martins, the Joyces, &amp;c.; founders of the great families, whose names
have since been inseparable from Galway. In after times the clanship and
attachment of these families to their members and each other, drew from
the Scripture-loving Puritans the scornful appellation&mdash;"The Tribes of
Galway"; but the expression was afterwards adopted by the Galway men as
an honourable mark of distinction between themselves and their cruel
oppressors. In old times the merchant princes of the place were renowned
for their hospitality, which they carried to such an excess that the
civil authorities interfered with it, in 1518, with a law to the effect
that</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"No man of this town shall oste or receive into their houses at</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Christmas, Easter, nor no feaste elles, any of the Burkes,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">MacWilliams, the Kellies, nor no cepte elles without license of</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">the Mayor and Councill, on payn to forfeit &pound;5; that neither O nor</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Mac shall strutte nor swaggere through the street of Gallway."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Indeed, the O's and Mac's seem to have made their history by more than
enjoying the hospitality of their neighbours, and what was not given
them willingly they at times took by the strength of their right hands.
Over the western gate of the city was the following meaningful
inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p class='center'>
"From the fury of the O'Flaherties, good Lord, deliver us."
</p>

<p>The trade with Spain was for centuries a source of great prosperity to
the town, and those familiar with the characteristics of Spanish
architecture will see much in Galway to remind them of it. The sympathy
of the townspeople seems always to have been with the leaders of forlorn
hopes in Irish history. It was almost destroyed by Ludlow for its
fidelity to the King in 1652, and having been rebuilt, it again fell
before the siege trains of the victorious Ginckle in 1691 after the
battle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span> of Aughrim, the Culloden of Ireland. With the fall of the
Jacobite standard in that battle, the hopes of the western Irish
declined. The surviving sons of most of the old families sought service
abroad in the armies of France, Spain, and Austria. There are many love
songs of the time in Irish, which have been translated, such as&mdash;</p>


<h3>AFTER AUGHRIM.</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Do you remember long-ago,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Kathaleen!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When your lover whispered low&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Shall I stay or shall I go,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Kathaleen?"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And you answered proudly, "Go,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And join King James and strike a blow</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">For the Green."</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Mavrone! your hair is white as snow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Kathaleen,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Your heart is sad and full of woe&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Do you repent you bade him go,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Kathaleen?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But still you answer proudly, "No,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Far better die with Sarsfield so,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Than live a slave without a blow</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">For the Green."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Many of the old houses remain. Far and away the most interesting is
Lynch's mansion at the corner of Abbey Gate-street. On the walls are the
arms of the Lynches and their crest, a lynx, which it is said was given
them for the watchfulness with which they guarded a besieged Austrian
town in the middle ages. Behind Saint Nicholas' Church, in
Market-street, is the Lynch stone, inscribed with a skull and
crossbones, and "Vanity of vanity, and all is but vanity," above which
is an inscription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"This memorial of the stern and unbending justice of the Chief
Magistrate of this city, James Lynch Fitzstephen, elected Mayor,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
A.D. 1493, who condemned and executed his own guilty son, Walter,
on this spot, has been restored to its ancient site A.D. 1854, with
the approval of the Town Commissioners, by their Chairman, Very
Rev. Peter Daly, P.P., and Vicar of Saint Nicholas."</p></div>

<p>The stern and unbending justice relates to the Mayor's execution of his
own son. The story tells how a young Spaniard, who was the Mayor's
guest, crossed in love the Mayor's son. One night, heated with wine and
inflamed with jealousy, young Lynch drove a stiletto through the heart
of his rival. His father tried and condemned him for the crime. His
mother roused the sympathy of the townspeople to such an extent that
none could be found to act as executioner, but the old Mayor was
even-handed with them, and hanged the unfortunate culprit with his own
hands.</p>

<p>No visitor to Galway will fail to find out the Claddagh. It is the most
conservative community in Ireland, and with them neither old times are
changed nor old manners gone. The colony inhabit a number of
low-thatched cottages apart from the town. They live mostly by fishing.
The Claddagh women dress in blue cloaks and red petticoats, and their
rings, which visitors procure as keepsakes, represent two hands holding
a harp. Hardman, in his "Rare History of Galway," wrote of them as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The colony, from time immemorial, has been ruled by one of their
own body, periodically elected, who is dignified with the title of
Mayor, regulates the community according to their own peculiar laws
and customs, and settles all their fishery disputes. His decisions
are so decisive and so much respected that the parties are seldom
known to carry their differences before a legal tribunal or to
trouble the civil magistrates."</p></div>

<h4>Arran Island, Claddagh.</h4>


<p>Salthill, to the west of the town, is a well-sheltered bathing-place,
with pleasant villas for visitors. The Queen's College will repay a
visit. At the bridge in the town excellent salmon fishing is to be had.
When<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span> the fish are making up the river for Corrib or Lough Mask the
sight is very interesting. From Galway the old Franciscan Monastery at
Claregalway may be driven to, or an excursion made down the bay to the
Arran Islands. They are twenty-seven miles from the harbour. There are
three principal islands, Innismore, Innismaan, and Innisheen, and
several small isles. Two centuries ago they were described as paved over
with stones, with wide openings between them for cattle to break their
legs, and the modern description by Hon. Emily Lawless does not far
differ.</p>

<p>The dress of the people is mostly white, homespun flannel "bawneens,"
and sandals of cowhide, fastened across the instep, which they call
"pampooties."</p>

<h2>Connemara and Sligo.</h2>


<p>The Great Southern and Western Railway line runs northward from Tuam to
Sligo. To the westward lies Iar Connaught and Connemara, the capital of
which is Clifden, standing high above Ardhear Bay. If we go direct from
Galway to Clifden we pass Oughterard and the ruins of Aughnanure Castle,
formerly the stronghold of "The furious O'Flahertys." From its Tower we
can get a view of Lough Corrib, with its famous Caislean-no-Circe, long
the lair of Grace O'Malley, of whom the western peasant may say she</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Fought, and sailed, and ruled,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And loved, and made our world."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Oughterard nowadays is given over to fishermen instead of the fighting
followers of the western chieftains. The Connaught Glendalough differs
much from its Leinster namesake, but the Maamturk Mountains and the Glen
of Innagh have a panorama of scenes difficult, indeed, to rival. Clifden
is an excellent centre from which to make excursions. Wherever we look
the Twelve Bens of Bumabeola spring up like uplifted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span> lances. The
coast-line is beautiful, and from the promontories we see distant Slyne
Head and the Isles of the West. Mountain climbers will find on the
summit of Urrisbeg a curious plateau. The district is a good one for
lake and sea fishing.</p>

<h4>Diamond Mountain, Letterfrack.</h4>


<p>The coast drive to Leenane should not be missed. Leenane itself is on
the outer flank of "Joyce's County," as a fiord of Killery Bay.
Letterfrack is but ten miles from Clifden. The mountain scenery in the
immediate vicinity of the town is delightful. Within easy reach is
Little Killery Bay and the beautiful valley, The Pass of Kylemore, near
which is Kylemore Castle, where Mitchell Henry started his model farm in
1864. The mountain pass of Lehinch cuts through the hills to the sea. A
journey by Ballinakill brings the adventuresome to Renvyle Bay, where
there is a comfortable hotel. Leenane is the best starting ground for an
expedition up the Twelve Bens; from it also a tour may be made to Cong.</p>

<p>About eight miles beyond Leenane is Errig Bridge, from which the best
view of Croagh Patrick Mountain may be had. But an ascent of the
mountain is best made from Murrisk Abbey, six miles outside Westport.
From the mountain side the expansive country from island-set Clew Bay to
Nephin and Slievemore, in Achill, spreads out to best advantage. The
famous coach road from Clifden cuts into Westport from the south. The
Quay and Mall and the Marquis of Sligo's demesne are the "sights" of the
town. It is a convenient centre from which to visit Achill Island. The
drive through Newport, Mallaranny, and Achill Sound to Dingort, although
across an exposed country, on a fine day will more than repay the
tourist.</p>

<p>The views of Clew Bay are like the changing scenes in a panorama.
Newport will clamour for the attention of fishermen; and lavish on them
opportunities for sport. The Glens on the way to Mallaranny will tempt
excursions, and beyond Burrishoole Bridge the antiquary will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span> deviate
to Carrighooley Castle, and lend his ears to the peasant tales of Grace
O'Malley and her husband, the MacWilliam.</p>

<p>Mallaranny is a home of rest. It hides beside a promontory in the bay,
and its splendid strand faces the south. The direct way to Achill is
through Dingort. For scenery and sport few places in the west surpass
the island. The mountain cliff scenery is superb. The seals breed in the
cliffs, and the rocks are the homes of countless seabirds. At Meenawn,
the eagles on the island mostly nest. The great horned wild goats offer
good sport to the marksman, and the deep-sea fisher will delight in the
shoals and "schools" of herring and mackerel which in the seasons strike
the coast and into the bays of the island. Did Izaac Walton but live in
our days he would be sure to find his way to Ballina, because of the Moy
River and the salmon which "most do congregate there." Loughs Conn and
Cullin are open free fishing, and on the preserves the terms are most
liberal. Foxford, beside Lough Conn, will gladden the hearts of those
interested in philanthropic schemes for the benefit of "the very poor"
in rural Ireland. Within a few years, enterprises well directed, has
transformed the district from being a "most distressful country" into a
thriving, self-respecting, self-advancing locality. Killala, six miles
from Ballina, is of interest as the point at which General Humbert and
1,100 Frenchmen invaded Ireland in 1798. Sligo is the most thriving town
in the west of Ireland. Its public buildings, its commerce, and its
picturesque position, are one and all notable. Sligo Abbey, a structure
of the thirteenth century, is a very remarkable pile of ruins. Lough
Gill contains most beautiful sylvan and sea pictures. There is sea,
lake, and river fishing <i>galore</i>, and mostly free. The point from which
to see Lough Gill in all its glory is Dooine Rock. Excursions may be
made to Hazelwood, Glencar, and even to Bundoran, the most deservedly
patronised watering-place in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span> the north-west of Ireland. Those who
desire an exquisite souvenir of a visit to Ireland, should not fail to
procure a piece of Belleek ware, remarkable for its elegance and
delicacy; and if in the vicinity of Belleek village, permission may be
obtained to visit the interesting pottery.</p>

<h2>Summer and Winter Resorts</h2>

<p>The health resorts of Ireland are so many, their attractions and
advantages so varied, that one wonders why it is that they are
comparatively so little patronised. The explanation is not far to seek.
Hitherto they have been but little known, one cause and another have
helped to keep Ireland a <i>terra incognita</i>. The "faculty," however, has
been for long acquainted with the benefits which the Green Isle
possesses, and many an insular invalid, consumed with the desire to
visit some continental resort, has taken the common sense advice of the
family physician and learned to appreciate the advantages Providence has
bestowed nearer home.</p>

<p>Winter quarters we have a good store, and beauty spots abound on the
coast, where summer delights can be enjoyed <i>galore</i>, to use an Irish
expression.</p>

<p>Most of the places referred to beneath have already been described in
the foregoing pages, but it will, perhaps, be convenient for those in
search of particular information as to health resorts and seaside
watering places, to have them collected in one chapter and listed
alphabetically&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>ARDMORE.</b>&mdash;Fishing village, five miles from Youghal, growing as a
watering place. Beautifully situated on southern shore of Bay.
Splendid strand, good opportunities for bathing. Deep-sea fishing,
mackerel, and herring "schools," plenty of lobsters. Cliff scenery
in vicinity; the bay is frequented by seals. Gaelic-speaking
peasantry. Round tower and ancient church. Good cottage
accommodation.</p>

<p><b>ARRAN ISLANDS.</b>&mdash;Three in number&mdash;Innismore, Innismaan,
Innisheer&mdash;standing out in the Atlantic, a sort of long harbour bar
to Galway Bay. Scenery cannot pretend to be attractive. Bathing and
deep-sea fishing. Splendid views of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span> cliff scenery on Clare Coast.
Steam trip up Galway Bay delightful. An enjoyable inn at Kilronan.</p>

<p><b>BALLYBUNION.</b>&mdash;Good watering place, splendid strand, fine cliff
scenery, sheer on Atlantic Ocean, plenty bathing accommodation.
Castle Hotel is comfortable, lodgings clean and cheap. Eight miles
from Listowel.</p>

<p><b>BLARNEY.</b>&mdash;Hydro, at St. Ann's Hill, on the side of pleasant uplands
overlooking old castle. Nicely wooded, with lake and trout stream.
Cottage homes, within grounds which are between six and seven
hundred acres in extent. Sandy soil and pine forests. The
residences well sheltered. Six miles from City Cork and Muskerry
tram; two miles G. S. W. Railway. Terms and particulars of
treatment, &amp;c., to be had from the medical officer, Dr. Altdorfer.</p>

<p><b>CAHIRCIVEEN.</b>&mdash;An inlet of Valencia Harbour, well sheltered, mild
winters. Coach drives through mountain scenery or along coast to
Waterville. Valencia three miles.</p>

<p><b>CASTLECONNELL.</b>&mdash;Fishing village on the Shannon, outside Limerick,
six miles. Possesses chalybeate spring. Beautiful river scenery,
and splendid fishing. The Shannon Hotel can be recommended.</p>

<p><b>DUNMORE EAST.</b>&mdash;Pleasant, quiet, and select seaside resort, eleven
miles from Waterford, at the mouth of the River Suir. Good strand,
well sheltered. Splendid sea fishing and exceptionally good harbour
for yachting or boating. Plenty of villa and lodging-accommodation,
demand for same on increase in season. Good bathing; good hotel.</p>

<p><b>GLENGARRIFF.</b>&mdash;Coach from Kenmare or Bantry. Beautiful scenery.
Inlet of Bantry Bay. Well wooded, mild climate, winter resort
beyond compare. Gulf Stream strikes coast in vicinity. Excellent
hotel accommodation. Good cottage accommodation. Plenty coaching
and boating facilities in summer; splendid sea bathing. Arbutus
grows wild.</p>

<p><b>KENMARE.</b>&mdash;One of the starting-points for the Grand Atlantic Coast
Drive. Thriving pleasant town at the head of the fiord.
Macgillicuddy Reeks stand out behind the town. Mountain climbers
will make ascent best from point beyond Sohaleen Bridge. Both the
Cork and Kerry sides of the bay are very beautiful and worthy of
investigation. The Southern Hotels Company has one of its branches
outside the railway station. The Lansdowne Arms is an old coaching
inn, famed for its mountain mutton and good claret.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p><b>KILKEE.</b>&mdash;The best bathing-resort in the three kingdoms. Splendid
facilities. The cliff scenery and coast walks attractive. Good
villa and cottage accommodation. Modern hotels on esplanade.</p>

<p><b>KILLARNEY</b>, see page 136.</p>

<p><b>LEHINCH.</b>&mdash;Bracing air from Atlantic. Good bathing. Bold coast
line. New hotel, fine golf links. Promises to be the most
up-to-date watering place in Clare.</p>

<p><b>LEENANE.</b>&mdash;The pleasant place on Killary Harbour. It has the
Mweelrea mountains behind it and the sea in front. The bay is
remarkable for sea fishing, while the salmon and trout angler will
have his heart's desire in Errif Lake. The Leenane Hotel stands
close to the shore, and the Aasleagh Hotel, high above the Errif,
is surrounded by demesne lands. The mountain scenery is remarkable.</p>

<p><b>LISDOONVARNA.</b>&mdash;Inland watering place. An old favourite health
resort now more easy of access than hitherto. The spas are
sulphurous and chalybeate. The hotel accommodation is unusually
good, but still insufficient for the summer and early autumn
visitors. The driving tours in the locality take in the most
delightful scenery in county Clare.</p>

<p><b>LUCAN.</b>&mdash;A very old spa. Beautiful sylvan retreat within nine
miles of Dublin. Scenery on upper Liffey and drives in vicinity
through charming country. The Hydro, equipped with every modern
advantage.</p>

<p><b>PARKNASILLA.</b>&mdash;THE PREMIER WINTER RESORT OF IRELAND. Hotel well
sheltered on fiord of Kenmare Bay. The grounds around beautifully
wooded and planted with luxuriant shrubs. Absolutely free from
winter cold. This country side the pride of Kerry. The seascape and
islands in vicinity delightful. Admirable arrangements for boating,
fishing, and coaching.</p>

<p><b>POULAPHOUCA.</b>&mdash;Approached from Harristown on the Tullow branch. The
upper Liffey winds here through a beautiful glen with a splendid
fall beyond Poulaphouca bridge. Splendid facilities for shooting and
fishing are afforded in the surrounding mountain country.
Convenient centre for pedestrian and cycle tours. Hotel immediately
above the Fall, also good hotel at Blessington: and four miles
higher up in the Wicklow Highlands, at Lacken, excellent hotel.</p>

<p><b>QUEENSTOWN.</b>&mdash;"The Paradise of Pensioners." The port of Cork
Harbour. Centre of American tourist traffic. Well sheltered. Long
the winter quarters of invalids. Every facility<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span> for visitors.
Within easy reach of Cork city. Excellent train service. In summer
steamer trips on beautiful river. Several good hotels; splendid
villa accommodation. A bright cheerful town, full of life and
change of colour. A well known specialist (Dr. A. Thomson), in his
"Physician's Note Book," puts the query&mdash;"Where should a
consumptive patient pass the winter months if he can't go abroad?"
and answers himself, "There is no place within Great Britain and
Ireland so well adapted for the residence of a consumptive patient
as Queenstown."</p>

<p><b>RECESS.</b>&mdash;Midway between Clifden and Kylemore, on the edge of the
western Glendalough, guarded behind by mountain scenery, secluded,
but all the more attractive to those weary of the busy haunts of
men. The lake and mountain scenery exceptionally wild. It is an
ideal resort for sportsmen.</p>

<p><b>TRAMORE.</b>&mdash;One of the most attractive watering places in Ireland.
Its name in English signifies "the great strand," and it is no
misnomer. The bathing facilities are the best on southern coast,
and are not, indeed, surpassed on any other coast. Splendid new
hotel up-to-date in every respect, and other hotels to suit all
classes, with fine race-course, plenty of lodgings and houses to be
had in the season. Twenty minutes run from Waterford by train.
Military bands in the summer. Exceptionally good place for
families. Tramore is a delightful seaside resort, built on a
gradual incline, with a southerly aspect, on the shores of the
broad Atlantic. The air is almost proverbial for its restorative
qualities, not only in popular but also in scientific opinion. It
is beyond all doubt that Tramore has as many hours of sunshine,
less rainfall, and more even temperature than any other seaside
town in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><b>VALENCIA.</b>&mdash;The next parish to America, the home of Atlantic cable
stations. The island remarkable for the number of tropical plants
which grow in the open. Climate unusually mild. Boating, sailing,
and bathing in the season. Deep-sea fishing with islanders. Good
hotel, comfortable, clean, and cheap. Other accommodation difficult
to obtain.</p>

<p><b>WATERFORD</b>, see page 112.</p>

<p><b>WATERVILLE.</b>&mdash;Principal posting place on Atlantic coast tour.
Splendid watering place, beautifully situated on strip of land
dividing mountain lake from sea. Fine strand. Sea and lake fishing.
The station for Mackey Bennet cable system. Three good hotels,
M'Elligott's and Galvin's, on the coast, and the Southern Hotel on
the shore of the picturesque Lough Currane, within a stone's throw
of the sea. Very good cottage accommodation in summer season.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<h2>Natural History of the South and West of Ireland.</h2>

<p class='center'>By R. <span class="smcap">Lloyd Praeger</span>, B.A., B.E., &amp;c.</p>


<p>The Natural History of the South and West of Ireland possesses a special
and peculiar interest in the occurrence in this region of a number of
plants and animals which are rare in or absent from Great Britain and
the adjoining portions of Europe. Let us first consider the general
geographical features of this area, and the geological characters which
have produced those features. Ireland has often been likened to a
saucer, consisting as it does of a great central plain, fringed with
mountain groups disposed around the coast. The plain has a slightly
undulating floor of Carboniferous limestone; the groups of hills are
mostly formed of older rocks, which break through the level limestones.
On our journey from Dublin to Athlone, or from Dublin to Mallow, we pass
across typical portions of the central plain; and the brown ridges of
Slieve Bloom and Devil's Bit, and the greener heights of the Galtees,
furnish good examples of the masses of older rocks that rise out of the
plain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>In considering the features and natural history of this wide area, it
will be convenient to divide it into districts, which we shall treat of
in the following order:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">1. Wicklow and Wexford.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">2. Waterford and East Cork.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">3. West Cork and Kerry.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">4. Clare and East Galway.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">5. West Galway and West Mayo.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">6. Sligo.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">7. The Central Plain and River Shannon.</span><br />
</p>


<p>1. <b>WICKLOW AND WEXFORD.</b>&mdash;Here we are on the East Coast, looking across
St. George's Channel towards the shores of Wales. The lovely county of
Wicklow is the most mountainous in Ireland, having 180 square miles over
1,000 feet elevation, and 25 square miles over 2,000. Wexford is lower
and more fertile. The coasts of both counties are in great measure flat
and sandy, and are the home of many rare plants. A number of species of
light soils and of gravelly shores have here their Irish headquarters,
such as the Round-headed Trefoil (<i>Trifolium glomeratum</i>) the Sea-Stock
(<i>Matthiola sinuata</i>), the rare Sea-Cudweed (<i>Diotis candidissima</i>), and
the Wild Asparagus (<i>A. officinalis</i>). The Murrough, a great gravel
beach backed by salt marshes which extends from Greystones to Wicklow,
and the marshes of the River Slaney, may be specially recommended to the
naturalist. These coasts are the only Irish locality for the handsome
ground-beetle, <i>Nebria complanata</i>, a typical South European animal. The
Wicklow mountains, which reach in Lugnaquilla a height of 3,039 feet,
are the main portion of the Leinster highlands, formed by a great mass
of granite which stretches from Dublin into county Kilkenny. Considering
their elevation this range is singularly devoid of alpine plants and
animals, but many interesting species inhabit the lower grounds, famous
on account of the beauty of the scenery.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the Lepidoptera several rare species are characteristic of the
district, such as the "Bath White" butterfly (<i>Pontia daplidice</i>), and
the "Four-spotted Footman" moth (<i>&OElig;nistis quadra</i>).</p>

<p>2. <b>WATERFORD AND EAST CORK.</b>&mdash;This is a picturesque district, formed
largely of slates and sandstones of Old Red Sandstone age. The coast
is mostly of very bold character, with towering cliff ranges. The
country is generally undulating and fertile, with occasional mountain
ranges, of which the Comeraghs are rendered especially interesting and
picturesque by the deep "cooms," embosoming tarns, which give them their
name. The Comeraghs and the lovely valley of the Blackwater furnish
particularly attractive ground for the naturalist. The flora and fauna
of this area are intermediate in character between that of the district
last considered and of the surpassingly interesting country that lies to
the westward, and which will next claim attention. Thus, the coasts
yield several of the rare plants mentioned in the last paragraph&mdash;for
instance, <i>Diotis</i> and <i>Asparagus</i> grow at Tramore; while at the same
time we first meet in this area with some of the most famous plants of
the south-west&mdash;London Pride (<i>Saxifraga umbrosa</i>), Kidney-leaved
Saxifrage (<i>S. Geum</i>), Great Butterwort (<i>Pinguicula grandiflora</i>),
Irish Spurge (<i>Euphorbia hiberna</i>). Two rare butterflies of this
district are <i>Dianth&aelig;cia c&aelig;sia</i> and <i>D. luteago</i> var. <i>Barrettii</i>; and
the largest of the British leaf-beetles, <i>Timarcha l&aelig;vigata</i>, has been
taken near Waterford, and at Tipperary.</p>

<h4>A Kerry ditchbank showing Pennywort two feet in height.</h4>


<p>3. <b>WEST CORK AND KERRY.</b>&mdash;This is one of the most beautiful and
interesting districts in the British Isles, and indeed in Europe. The
ancient Devonian rocks which prevail have been folded into a grand
series of simple arches and troughs, the axes running north-east and
south-west. The arches form noble mountain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span> ranges, which on the coast
project far into the Atlantic in a series of grand promontories, and
inland form picturesque highlands, of which Macgillicuddy's Reeks, which
rise to 3,404, constitute the highest land in Ireland. The valleys in
their lower portions are occupied by the sea, in the form of long
island-studded fiords; their upper parts are often filled with
Carboniferous limestone, and offer a pleasant contrast of tillage and
green pasture between the gaunt brown mountain-ribs. Here we stand on
the most western outpost of the European Continent, with the Atlantic on
three sides. The effect of the encompassing ocean, and the western winds
which constantly blow in from it, is to produce here and along the whole
western coast the most uniform annual temperature to be found in Europe.
Frosts are almost unknown, and great heat and drought likewise. These
peculiar climatic conditions have resulted in the acquisition and
preservation of a fauna and flora which spread here from more southern
latitudes at some time now long gone by, and which in these favoured
spots still remain to remind us of a period when a state of things
prevailed very different from what obtains at present. For naturalists
tell us that there can be no doubt that these southern plants and
animals migrated to Ireland over land-surfaces now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span> destroyed, having
spread along the old-time coast line which long ago extended from the
Pyrenean highlands to Ireland; and as a relic of their march, we find
some of the species still surviving in the south-west of England,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span> while
all of them are absent from the rest of England and from the adjoining
parts of continental Europe.</p>

<p>An enumeration of a few of the most remarkable of the plants, with a
definition of their range, will make clearer this peculiar feature of
the natural history of the West of Ireland:&mdash;</p>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/img265.jpg" alt="Saxifraga umbrosa" title="Saxifraga umbrosa" /></div>


<h4>Saxifraga umbrosa.</h4>


<p>London Pride (<i>Saxifraga umbrosa</i>). In Ireland along the west and south
coasts. Absent from England. On the Continent it is found only in the
south.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p>Kidney-leaved Saxifrage (<i>S. Geum</i>). In Ireland in the south-west.
Unknown in England. On the Continent confined to the Pyrenean district</p>

<p>Strawberry-tree (<i>Arbutus unedo</i>). In Ireland in the south-west. Unknown
in England. On the Continent it grows all along the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Great Butter wort (<i>Pinguicula grandiflora</i>). In Ireland in the
south-west. Unknown in England. On the Continent it grows on the Alps
and in the south-west.</p>

<p>Irish Spurge (<i>Euphorbia hiberna</i>). In Ireland along the south and west
coasts. In England it is confined to Devonshire. On the Continent it
occurs only in the south-west.</p>

a group of three kinds of Heath with the same peculiar distribution:&mdash;</p>


<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">St. Dabeoc's Heath (<i>Dabeocia polifolia</i>). In Ireland</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">in Connemara. Unknown in England. On the</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Continent confined to the south-west.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Mediterranean Heath (<i>Erica mediterranea</i>). In</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ireland in Connemara. Unknown in England.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">On the Continent confined to the south-west.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Mackay's Heath (<i>E. Mackaiana</i>). In Ireland in</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Connemara. Unknown in England. On the</span><br />

</p>

<p>Nor is it the plants alone that exhibit the peculiar relation existing
between the Natural History of Ireland<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span> and of the Pyrenean region.
Among the animals the same features may be observed, the most striking
instance being the peculiar Kerry Slug (<i>Geomalacus maculosus</i>), which
is abundant in many parts of the extreme south-west of Ireland, and is
elsewhere found only in Portugal.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/img269.jpg" alt="The Kerry Slug" title="The Kerry Slug" /></div>

<p class='center'><i>Drawing&mdash;Dr. R. F. Scharff.</i></p>

<h4>The Kerry Slug.</h4>


<p>Mixed with these southern forms in the West of Ireland we find another
group of still stranger affinities. In pools and lakes from Kerry to
Donegal grows the curious Pipe-wort (<i>Eriocaulon septangulare</i>). It may
be also found in the Island of Skye, in the West of Scotland, but
nowhere else in Europe; to see it again we must go to the northern
regions of North America, where it flourishes under conditions much more
rigorous than those which obtain in its mild Irish home. The deliciously
fragrant orchid, <i>Spiranthes Romanzoviana</i>, grows in the counties of
Cork, Armagh, Antrim, and Londonderry; elsewhere only in sub-arctic
America and the portion of Asia which most nearly approaches the Alaskan
shores. The "Blue-eyed Grass" of Canada (<i>Sisyrinchium angustifolium</i>)
is likewise confined to the West of Ireland and to North America; and
further instances might be quoted. In the animal kingdom, too, parallel
cases have been noted, the most interesting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span> being the discovery of no
less than three American species of fresh-water sponge, which are
unknown in the rest of Europe.</p>

<p>To account for the presence of this American group naturalists are
driven, as in the case of the southern species, to the conclusion that
these represent one of the very oldest components of our existing fauna
and flora, and point to a period when the edge of Europe was prolonged
far to the north-west, forming a continuous land area, presumably by way
of Iceland and Greenland, to America. And here on the wild western coast
of Ireland these last inhabitants of the lost lands of Europe still
survive.</p>

<p>4. <b>CLARE AND EAST GALWAY.</b>&mdash;Our last district&mdash;West Cork and Kerry&mdash;was
characterised by great ribs of slate and sandstone, and by an absence of
limestone and the numerous plants which follow in its train. The present
district forms a marked contrast, being largely composed of
Carboniferous limestone. And the remarkable thing about these limestones
is that they are over many miles totally devoid of any covering of soil
or clay; the grey gnarled rock, fantastically carved and crevassed by
the action of rain and weather, lies naked and bare. But in the crevices
of the rock a wonderful variety of rare and beautiful plants abound. One
or two of these have their home in the far south, like the plants we
have lately considered, notably the little Close-flowered Orchid,
<i>Neotinea intacta</i>, whose nearest station is about Nice. But the
majority of the interesting species of these limestones are alpine
plants, usually found at high elevations on mountains, which here form
sheets of verdure down to the very edge of the sea. The Mountain Dryas
(<i>D. octopetala</i>), the Bearberry (<i>Arctostaphylos Uva-ursi</i>), the lovely
Spring Gentian (<i>G. verna</i>), and the Blue Moor-grass (<i>Sesleria
c&aelig;rulea</i>) are good examples, all of them growing in great abundance from
the hill-tops down to the shore. It is this strange mingling of plants
from the far south, from the far north, and from the mountains, which
renders the West of Ireland so fascinating a field for the botanist. In
the barren district of Clare, and in the adjoining Isles of Arran and
south-west portion of county Galway, this peculiar flora may be seen in
its greatest perfection. Some very rare insects have been taken in
eastern Galway, including the Lepidoptera <i>Nallia ancilla</i> and <i>Lyc&aelig;na
artexerus</i>.</p>

<h4>Wolf Spider (<i>Pisaura
mirabilis</i>) spinning nest for young.</h4>


<p>5. <b>WEST GALWAY AND WEST MAYO</b>.&mdash;In this district we have again a
complete change of geology and of scenery. The grey limestones with rich
grass and rare flowers filling every crevice are gone, and we are in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
wild region of ancient metamorphic rocks&mdash;schists, quartzites, gneisses,
and granites&mdash;which form wide moorlands, dotted with innumerable
lakelets, with noble mountain groups rising over the wild boggy
lowlands. To the student of metamorphism the geology of this area is of
very high interest. The botanist finds himself once again, as in Kerry,
in a focus of the southern flora already discussed. As stated above,
Connemara contributes to the list of Pyrenean plants three Heaths, of
which St. Dabeoc's Heath is the loveliest of the British representatives
of the order. Here we may also meet again our old Kerry friends the
London Pride, and on Inisbofin the Irish Spurge&mdash;plants which strictly
avoid the limestone, as do the Heaths. The American element is
represented by the Pipe-wort, which is common, and the little water
plant, <i>Naias flexilis</i>, which grows near Roundstone. Of the three
famous Heaths, St. Dabeoc's is abundant throughout Connemara, becoming
rarer in Mayo. The Mediterranean Heath grows near Roundstone, and in
immense abundance on the north side of Clew Bay, and again near the
north-west corner of Mayo, extending inland as far as Lough Conn.
Mackay's Heath is the rarest, being confined to the neighbourhood of
Roundstone. As regards its fauna, Connemara and West Mayo yield fewer
peculiar species than the south-west; but much remains to be done before
it can be said that the zoology of this area is thoroughly known, and it
offers a most promising field for the explorer.</p>


<p>6. <b>SLIGO.</b>&mdash;The visitor who makes Sligo his headquarters finds himself
in a district of much variety and interest. This is a district that
cannot be too highly recommended to the naturalist. To the geologist the
fossiliferous limestones and the metamorphic rocks are alike of
interest. The botanist naturally turns to the Ben Bulben Mountains,
which harbour the richest group of alpine plants to be found in Ireland,
including the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span> pretty <i>Arenaria ciliata</i>, which does not grow elsewhere
in the British Isles. To the zoologist a rich field lies waiting. A
recent exploration of the limestone glens by a party of English and
Irish conchologists has shown that in variety of land mollusca this
district surpasses almost any other in these islands; and good results
may be confidently expected in other invertebrate groups.</p>


<p>7. <b>THE CENTRE.</b>&mdash;The area comprised in the field of operations of the
Great Southern and Western Railway Company include the southern half of
the great Central Plain of Ireland and the lower course of the Shannon,
the largest river in the British Isles. Towards the east the counties of
Carlow and Kilkenny include much picturesque ground, especially along
the courses of the rivers Nore and Barrow; and as picturesque ground
implies the existence of hill and valley, wood and rock, the naturalist
will find himself at home here. The flora is rich, though without any
very marked features; the Nettle-leaved Bell-flower (<i>Campanula
Trachelium</i>) being the most characteristic species. Regarding the fauna
much has still to be learned. In Tipperary, Queen's County, and King's
County we are in typical central plain country&mdash;great tracts of slightly
undulating drift-covered Carboniferous limestone, the surface including
wide pastures, cultivated ridges, and large areas of peat bog and marsh.
The bogs, which form so peculiar a feature of the surface of Ireland,
may be studied here over many miles of country. The noble Shannon, which
winds slowly southward across the plain, widens at intervals into great
lake-like expanses, of which Lough Derg is the largest, a place of much
interest to the student of natural history. One plant which grows here,
the Willow-leaved Inula (<i>I. salicina</i>), is found nowhere else in the
British Isles; other characteristic Shannon plants are the Water
Germander (<i>Teucrium Scordium</i>) and the rare Stone wort <i>Chara<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
tomentosa</i>. Further west, in Limerick, a more varied surface prevails.
Like Waterford and Cork, Limerick is a great centre for animals of the
"Southern" distributional type, such as the Wood White Butterfly
(<i>Leptidia sinapis</i>) the Brimstone Butterfly (<i>Gonapteryx rhamm</i>), and
the Purple Hair-streak (<i>Thecla quercus</i>). The small but handsome
Ground-beetle, <i>Panog&aelig;us crux-major</i>, is known in Ireland only from
Finlough. This species has a typically "germanic" distribution in Great
Britain. The Water-beetle <i>Pelobius Hermanni</i>, a very rare species, and
the only British member of its family, occurs near Limerick and Cork.
Cratloe Wood, by the Shannon near Limerick, may be specially recommended
as a hunting-ground.</p>

<h2>SPORT.</h2>


<p>For sportsmen Ireland is a happy land, ready to supply their every want.
Royal Meath, Kildare, Waterford, Tipperary, and Cork County are hunted
by several good packs during-each season, and "the meets" are duly
published in the local newspapers.</p>

<p>In the large tracts of bog, moorland, river reaches, and mountain lands
there is splendid shooting; in Kerry especially, where poaching is put
down with a heavy hand, there are plenty of opportunities for sport.</p>

<p>In most cases the hosts of the hotels have secured the shooting of many
thousands of acres in their vicinity.</p>

<p>When the weather is "hard," excellent sport can be had along the
southern districts.</p>

<p>The gentry most usually preserve their estates with great vigilance, but
they are generous in giving permission to bona-fide sportsmen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<h3>GENERAL HINTS</h3>

<h4>(<span class="smcap">From Mecredy's Road Book of Ireland</span>.)</h4>


<p>June and September are the driest months in Ireland. Tourists will find
the Royal Irish Constabulary the best source of information, and they
cannot do better than inquire at the various police barracks on the way
for advice as to places of interest to be visited, and the condition of
the roads. In unfrequented country districts the footpaths as a rule may
be taken with impunity, but it is never absolutely safe to do so. It is
always well to enquire of other cyclists met <i>en route</i>. The roads are
very variable, some being grand and others very bad. Intercourse with
the peasantry will be found interesting and amusing. Nothing can exceed
their civility and courtesy; and for those who are not too particular it
will be found an excellent plan to lunch in their cottages, excellent
tea, home-made bread, butter and eggs being procurable for 1/-per head.
There is little use questioning them as to distances, however. They are
nearly always wrong, and in any case they calculate in Irish miles&mdash;11
Irish equal 14 English. The police, however, are reliable, and give the
distances in statute miles. Repairers are few and far between, but the
local blacksmiths are often clever and handy men. The by-roads are
generally better than the main roads, and the surface is better at the
edge than in the middle. The mountain roads are as a rule very good, and
not nearly so hilly as one would expect. The country people are rather
stupid about getting out of one's way, and live stock on the road are a
frequent source of danger, especially pigs, sheep, donkeys, and Kerry
cows. Mountain passes should be negotiated carefully, as mountain
torrents sometimes sweep away short<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span> stretches of otherwise excellent
roads, and one comes on these spots unexpectedly. The corners, too, are
excessively sharp, and steep pitches occur unexpectedly.</p>

<p>In most small Provincial towns the Hotels are not good, but in tourists'
districts, such as Kerry, they are really excellent and the charges are
reasonable. Where lodgings are required it is a good plan to ask the
local Head Constable for advice.</p>


<h3>CORK DISTRICT.</h3>

<p>Cork is an excellent centre for cycling. The roads are in fair order and
the inclines moderate. There is abundance of fine scenery, and notably
in the extreme south and south-west where there are some entrancing
tit-bits. Magnificent tracts of inland mountain scenery are to be found,
and many important historical and arch&aelig;ological ruins. There are hotels
nearly everywhere within easy reach, many of them very good, and in most
cases affording fair accommodation at reasonable cost.</p>

miles, or from Glengarriff the tourist can ride to Parknasilla, 16 miles
from Kenmare, where there is an excellent modern hotel and some of the
loveliest scenery in Ireland.</p>


<h3>LIMERICK DISTRICT.</h3>

<p>To the cyclist on tour, Limerick and the surrounding districts offer
many scenic attractions in wood, lake, and river. The roads are not good
as a rule, owing in a great measure, to the fact that the city is the
centre of a large agricultural district. The hotels in the city are
good, and in the surrounding towns and villages the tourist will find
good accommodation in hotels and otherwise.</p>

<h4>One Day Tours from Limerick.</h4>

<p>No. 1.&mdash;Perhaps the easiest one day tour which the cyclist can enjoy
from Limerick, as his head quarters, is to Doonass Falls <i>via</i> Clonlara.
Five miles thence by O'Brien's Bridge, 7 miles, to Killaloe, where an
excellent lunch can be had. The return home can be made by
Castleconnell, the popular resort of the devotees of "Izaak Walton,"
where an excellent tea can be had at the Shannon Hotel.</p>

<p>No. 2.&mdash;Castleconnell and Clare Glens, and lengthened visit to
Castleconnell to view the waterfalls, "The World's End"&mdash;a remarkably
fine reach of the River Shannon. There is much to interest the visitor
in the gigantic eel fishery, and here also is the renowned Enright,
whose fishing rods are used all over the world. The Clare Glen, situated
by the way in Limerick county, is not far from Castleconnell; and if
liberty is obtained beforehand, the Glenstal Demesne, seat of the
Barrington family, can be visited. Sir Charles Barrington, the present
baronet, has never yet refused permission to the cycling tourist to view
the charming scenery surrounding the Glenstal Castle.</p>

<p>No. 3.&mdash;Askeaton, 16-1/2 miles, splendid road, one of the best from
Limerick; famous old abbey to be visited, with excellent fishing on the
Deel, granted that the tourist has obtained the requisite permission.</p>

<p>No. 4.&mdash;Adare, 9 miles; roads pretty good. Mr. P. Fitzgerald, J.P.,
Agent to Lord Dunraven, should be written to beforehand for a permit to
visit the demesne, where some fine old ruins are in an excellent state
of preservation. The Manor House is a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span> magnificent building, but
visitors are only allowed to enter when the family are away. This is
well known as the district which inspired Gerald Griffin to write one of
his famous poems. Lunch can be had at very moderate terms at the
Dunraven Arms Hotel. The demesne wall turns eastward to Croom. The name
of this village is derived from the old war cry of the Geraldines,
"Munster Branch "&mdash;<i>Crom-a-boo</i>. To Limerick, from Croom, <i>via</i>
Patrick's Well, there is a pretty good road, 10 miles.</p>

<h4>Two Days Tours from Limerick.</h4>

<p>Ballybunion. Good roads generally, but slightly up-hill when the Kingdom
is reached. This charming seaside resort is rapidly coming to rival
Kilkee. It has splendid bathing accommodation, and the coast scenery and
caves equal to those of any other watering place in Ireland. The visitor
for the first time makes his acquaintance with the Lartique, or "Single
Line," Railway&mdash;the only one in the United Kingdom&mdash;from Listowel to
Ballybunion, a distance of 8 miles.</p>

<p>Returning to Limerick, a digression can be made to Shanid Castle, near
Shanagolden. This towering mass of masonry, perched high on a
hill&mdash;three sides of which are precipitous&mdash;is almost ignored by
tourists. It was one of the strongholds of the Desmonds. The other spots
on the Shannon&mdash;homeward bound&mdash;are Glinn, where the hereditary Knight
of Glin has his seat, and where Gerald Griffin resided in his young
days, near the pretty little village of Loughill. Foynes and Foynes
Island, seat of Sir Aubrey de Vere, will repay a visit. Hotels are good
on this line, also roads.</p>

<p>No. 2.&mdash;Waterford and Tramore. Decent roads and accommodation, as good
as can be got once outside Limerick county, border at the Limerick
Junction, a distance of 20 miles from the Treaty Stone. Splendid views
of the Galtee ranges can be had, and on towards Clonmel the wooded
slopes of the minor ranges and hills are a delightful picture. If time
affords, the tourist can digress from the main road and visit the famous
Glen of Aherlow. Back to Tipperary for lunch, good hotels, and splendid
roads. Visit the Kickham monument, and then on to Clonmel. Excellent
accommodation to be had at Clonmel. Next day Waterford and Tramore, and
back.</p>

<h4>Tours for Three or more Days from Limerick.</h4>

<p>Ballybunion, Tarbert, Kilrush, Kilkee, Lisdoonvarna, from Ballybunion.
See "No. 1 Day Tours." Tarbert is only a few miles from Ballybunion.
There is a steamboat service across the Shannon estuary to Kilrush.
Thence to Kilkee by road, where first night out can be had. Next day to
Spanish Point,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span> Milltownmalbay, Lisdoonvarna, to the famous "Spa"; home
<i>via</i> Ennis, splendid roads.</p>

<p>No. 2.&mdash;Killaloe, Scariff, Portumna, and Upper Shannon. A most enjoyable
trip can be had from Killaloe. See "No. 1 Day Tour." There is a constant
steamboat service on Lough Derg, which will take a cyclist and his
machine, and land him at Scariff&mdash;on the Clare side&mdash;or Portumna,
"Galway." From either of these towns a tourist can have his chance of
the most diversified lake and river scenery to be had in the kingdom.
Without doubt the praises of Lough Derg and the Upper Shannon have not
been sung sufficiently. From Portumna to Dromineer, on the Tipperary
shore, by lake steamer, thence to Nenagh on bike; splendid roads home to
Limerick, 27 miles.</p>


<h3>KILLARNEY DISTRICT.</h3>

<p>Killarney is an ideal centre for the cyclist. Good roads proceed in
every direction, and mounted on his favourite machine the wheelman will
be able to discover and investigate scenic treasures unknown to the
ordinary tourist.</p>

<h4>One Day Tours from Killarney.</h4>

<p>No. 1.&mdash;Killarney to Gap of Dunloe, 10 miles; Owenreagh Glen, 18 miles;
Windy Gap, 30 miles. Killarney, total, 36 miles. Care should be taken to
keep on the proper road through the Glen; there are many crossings. Any
of the local folk will point out the road.</p>

<p>No. 2.&mdash;Killarney to Torc Waterfall, 3 miles; return to Muckross Hotel,
4 miles; enter demesne at Dinis, 10 miles; on to Kenmare road and home
to Killarney, 17 miles. The road through Muckross Demesne is in some
places dangerous owing to its steep and winding character.</p>

<p>No. 3.&mdash;Killarney to Ross Castle, 1-1/2 miles; through demesne to
Library Point, 2-1/2 miles. Back through Ross Island and demesne to
Mahony's Point, 9-1/2 miles; Killarney, 12-1/2 miles. This road is
perfectly safe and good, except two descents in Ross Island. Returning
from Mahony's Point to Killarney by Aghadoe, about 15 miles, splendid
view of Lower Lake and mountains can be had from the old ruins of
Aghadoe.</p>

<p>No. 4.&mdash;Killarney to Glenflesk <i>via</i> Lough Guittane. Visit Robbers' Den,
9 miles, home <i>via</i> Headford and Barraduff, 26 miles. Roads good,
scenery wild and romantic. There are many short and beautiful trips
which can be made in and about the neighbourhood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<h4>Two Day Tours from Killarney.</h4>

<p>No. 1.&mdash;Killarney to Windy Gap, 16 miles; thence to Parknasilla across
mountain. Total, 30 miles. Remain for night at Southern Hotel,
Parknasilla. Parknasilla to Kenmare, 14 miles, and back to Killarney
<i>via</i> Kilgarvan. Total, 35 miles. Roads fairly good, but in places very
steep, so that riders must keep a careful watch.</p>

<p>No. 2.&mdash;Killarney to Beaufort, 6 miles; thence to Glencar, 19 miles, and
on to Caragh Lake Hotel, 27 miles. Remain at Caragh Lake Hotel for the
night. Return to Killarney <i>via</i> Windy Gap and Gerah Cross. There are
some sharp turns and steep descents requiring care.</p>

<h4>Tours for Three or more Days from Killarney.</h4>

<p>No. 1.&mdash;Killarney to Kenmare, 20 miles. Thence by Glengarriff, 40 miles,
to Macroom, <i>via</i> Inchigeela, Pass of Keimaneigh to Millstreet, and back
to Killarney. Hotels at Kenmare (Southern Hotel), Glengarriff,
Inchigeela, Macroom, and Millstreet.</p>

<p>No. 2.&mdash;Killarney to Killorglin. Caragh Lake, Cahirciveen, visit
Valentia, Waterville, Parknasilla, Kenmare, and back to Killarney by
either rail or road.</p>


<h3>WATERFORD DISTRICT.</h3>

<p>Waterford can be recommended as a cycling centre, as the scenery in many
districts of the South-east of Ireland is beautiful in the extreme, and
can compare favourably with any in the country, and the roads are first
rate. The hotels, too, are generally very good, and have been improved
wonderfully of late, and the tariffs have been so arranged by the
South-eastern Branch of the Irish Cyclist Association, that all
requirements of the most slender purse can be satisfactorily arranged.</p>

<p>Below we sketch out a few very enjoyable Tours which can be made, taking
Waterford as the starting point:&mdash;</p>

<h4>First Tour from Waterford.</h4>

<p>Leaving-Waterford by the Newtown-road, we pass the house in which Lord
Roberts spent his early days, and where his father and mother lived for
many years. This is actually in the Borough<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span> and, from the grounds
surrounding it, a capital view of the river and part of the City can be
had. After passing by Newtown we keep along to the left until Parkswood
is reached, when we run under a bridge and up a hill to Checkpoint, and
here a magnificent view can be obtained. From the hill overlooking this
pretty little village seven counties can be seen. Dunbrody Abbey, one of
the most famous ecclesiastical ruins in Ireland, is situated immediately
opposite on the other side of the river. Duncannon Fort, a short
distance from here, comes into view, and we are enabled to see the
joining of the three rivers&mdash;Suir, Nore, and Barrow. We pass from
Checkpoint, and we reach Passage, a famous fishing station since the
herring industry has become so prosperous in this part of Ireland. A
little further on is Woodstown, and right opposite on the far side of
the river can be seen Duncannon Fort, a fortified place in the days of
old. Turning to the right by Ballyglan, we mount a steep incline, and we
then come in view of Hook Tower, a beacon light which is said to be the
oldest in the kingdom. Dunmore, about five miles from Woodstown, is one
of the most picturesque, beautiful, and delightful resorts in the whole
of Ireland. Here there is a magnificent pier, and boating and fishing
can be enjoyed to one's heart's content. Wheeling back in the Waterford
direction we make for Tramore, ten miles away. It is beautifully
situated, and the visitor here can spend several hours in viewing the
most attractive scenery. Close to the town are the Golf Links and the
Race Course.</p>

<p>From Tramore to Waterford the run is over a splendid level road, and the
distance seven miles.</p>

<p>The full distance of this run is 33 miles, and at all the principal
points capital hotel accommodation can be had.</p>

<h4>Tour Two, from Waterford.</h4>

<p>The first part of this run is to Passage. At the Half-way House take the
turn over the bridge, up the hill and down a steep decline to Passage.
At the latter place the ordinary ferryboat can be taken to Ballyhack,
which is directly opposite. The run from Ballyhack to Duncannon is over
a fairly surfaced road. At the latter place M'Gonnigal's hotel is well
appointed. From Duncannon the run to the famous Hook Tower is about
seven miles, and the surface of the road generally is very good. Along
this run a splendid view of the Harbour can be obtained, and on the way
there are several places of interest&mdash;Loftus Hall, the Irish seat of the
Marquis of Ely, stands on the edge of the river unprotected by a single
tree. It was modernised within the last 25 years, and is now a
splendidly appointed mansion. Bag-an-Bun, a little distance off, will
well repay a visit&mdash;the coast line at this point being the principal
attraction. From Hook we run to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span> Fethard, 6 miles to the left, and here
a very pleasant hour can be spent. Tintern Abbey is the next point to be
visited. This is one of the most famous Abbeys in the country. From
Tintern to Dunbrody the distance is 8 miles, and here we can spend a
considerable time in viewing the great historical ruin, said to be one
of the finest in the whole of Ireland. Leaving Dunbrody we come to the
ferry of Ballinlaw, and crossing here ride by Snow-hill and Bellview
into Waterford. The full distance of this ride is 41 miles.</p>

<h4>Tour Three from Waterford.</h4>

<p>Proceeding up the Cork road we ride up Ballyaneeshagh Hill, and on the
left see Butlerstown Castle, an ancient building: which, in the days of
Cromwell, held out for sometime against his forces. At the Sweep we turn
round to the right and run to the bottom of the hill. A little way from
the end of the hill the right turn is to be taken again to Kilmeaden, 8
miles. The ride then is to Portlaw four miles away. Some fifty years ago
this town was the seat of a great cotton industry. It has since fallen
into decay, and the place looks like Goldsmith's "Deserted Village."
Just outside the town is the magnificent demesne of Curraghmore, said to
be the finest in the three kingdoms. The variety of scenery here is
almost unsurpassed. Curraghmore is the property of the Marquis of
Waterford. It is one of the great points of vantage to tourists and
pic-nic parties. Passing through the demesne we come to the house
itself, a modern and rather unpretentious structure. The court-yard is,
however, very large, and is said to be capable of accommodating close
upon 100 horses. Clonegam Church, where Lord William Beresford, uncle to
the present Marquis of Waterford, was laid to rest, can be seen on the
right glistening in the trees on the hill side. Through Curraghmore we
ride to Clonea, about 5 miles further on, and then to the foot of the
Comeragh Mountains, which occupy a centre of the county, and which are
to be seen from all parts, as well as from a considerable portion of
Tipperary. The greatest natural curiosity in this range is the
appearance and site of an almost circular lake, by name Coomshinawin.
From Coomshinawin to Kilmacthomas the distance is about 8 miles.
Kilmacthomas Woollen Factory may be visited, and a good hotel
accommodation can be had at Walsh's. From Kilmacthomas to Waterford is
16-1/2 miles over a good road, the full distance being 45 miles.</p>

<h4>Tour Four, from Waterford.</h4>

<p>Our next tour will be from Waterford, <i>via</i> the Sweep, to Knockaderry, 9
miles away. At the latter place there is a very fine lake which amply
supplies the City. Leaving Knockaderry we reach Dunhill, close to which
place is the Castle of Donile,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span> still distinguished for its peculiar and
romantic situation, and in ancient times the property of De-La-Poer,
from whom the present Marquis is descended. The village of Annestown,
distant about one mile, is on the sea coast, and from it a magnificent
view of rock and ocean scenery can be had. The run from Annestown to
Tramore is over a beautiful road, and many pretty views of the coast can
be seen. The spin to Waterford completes this tour, which is one of
nearly thirty miles.</p>


<h4>Two Day Tours from Waterford. No. 1.</h4>

<p>Waterford, Dunmore, Annestown, Bonmahon, Stradbally, and Dungarvan.</p>

<p class='center'><b>FIRST DAY.</b></p>

<p>This is rather a long run of 47 miles, but as the roads are generally
good and the scenery delightful it should be most enjoyable to the
Cyclist who may feel in good form. We have already spoken of Annestown.
From Annestown to Bonmahon the distance is over 5 miles. The road is
very hilly, but the surface is splendid. At Bonmahon the once famous
Knockmahon Mines are situated. These mines were the most valuable in the
country about fifty years ago, but when the value of the metal (copper)
fell operations were discontinued. Stradbally, 4 miles further on, is a
delightful little village, said to be the most health-restoring place on
the south-eastern coast. Here Whelan's Hotel is recommended. Dungarvan
is 8 miles further on, and the road by the sea is well surfaced and very
picturesque. At Dungarvan Lawlor's Hotel will be found very comfortable.</p>

<p class='center'><b>SECOND DAY.</b></p>

<p>A good run can be taken through Ardmore, Youghal, Lismore, and
Cappoquin, part of which tour embraces the delightful Valley of the
Blackwater. This complete run will tot about 50 miles.</p>

<p>At Ardmore a very comfortable hotel is kept by Miss Prendergast. At
Youghal, the Greenpark Hotel is a capital one. In Lismore, the
Devonshire Arms and Blackwater Vale Hotels are recommended; and Kenny's
at Cappoquin is also a good one.</p>


<h4>Two Day Tours from Waterford. No. 2.</h4>

<p class='center'><b>FIRST DAY.</b></p>

<p>Piltown to Curraghmore, round by Coomshinawin. This complete run will be
about 40 miles. The roads generally are capital, and the scenery as fine
as can be seen in this part of the country.</p>

<p class='center'><b>SECOND DAY.</b></p>

<p>From Dungarvan, round by Ballymacarbery, Newcastle, Ardfinan, Clogheen,
Melleray Abbey, to Dungarvan. This ride<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span> runs close upon 60 miles, and
to undertake it the tourist must have been in cycling form for a
considerable time. The roads, however, are generally very good.
Ballymacarbery is 15 miles from Dungarvan; Ardfinan, about 26; then from
Ardfinan to Clogheen the ride is 6 miles, and from that to Melleray
about 13. At Melleray, from the Abbey, a grand view can be had of some
of the most beautiful scenery in the whole of the county.</p>

<p>The following are the best places of refreshment <i>en
route</i>:&mdash;Ballymacarbery (Miss Power's), Newcastle, and Ardfinan. Two
good licensed houses. Clogheen&mdash;The Hotel. Melleray&mdash;The traveller will
always be hospitably received here.</p>

<h4>Three or more Day Tours from Waterford. No. 1.</h4>

<p>Waterford, Dunmore, 11; Tramore, 22; Dunhill, 27; Annestown, 28;
Bonmahon, 34; Stradbally, 38; and Dungarvan, 47 miles.</p>

<p class='center'><b>SECOND AND THIRD DAYS.</b></p>

<p>To Dungarvan&mdash;have been previously referred to.</p>

<p>Instead of returning to Waterford by rail, the tourist on the fourth day
may enjoy a most entertaining tour, <i>via</i> the Pike,
Coomshinawin&mdash;previously referred to&mdash;Curraghmore, Piltown, and
Waterford. This run measures something like 40 miles.</p>

<p><b>Three or more Day Tours from Waterford, No. 2.</b></p>

<p>Waterford, Mullinavat, 8; Ballyhack, 16; Stoneyford, 21; Danesfort, 25;
Kilkenny, 30; Thomastown, 40; and Inistioge, 47-1/2 miles.</p>

<p class='center'><b>SECOND DAY.</b></p>

<p>New Ross, 10; Waterford, 33; and Rosslare, 42 miles.</p>

<p class='center'><b>THIRD DAY.</b></p>

<p>Lady's Island, 4; Kilmore, 11; Fethard, 20; Hooktower, 26; Duncannon,
35; and Waterford, 46 miles.</p>

<p>This latter tour embraces some of the finest scenery on the
south-eastern coast, and the inland scenery at Inistioge is equal to any
to be seen in any part of Ireland.</p>


<p class='center'><i>IMPORTANT NOTE.</i></p>

<p>The tariffs for Members of the Irish Cyclists' Association and Cyclists'
Touring-Club are at most of the hotels in the south-eastern districts:&mdash;</p>

<p>Breakfast.&mdash;Tea, coffee, or cocoa, with bread and butter, toast and
preserve, ham and eggs, chops, steaks, cold meat, or fish, <i>2s.</i>
Substantial Luncheon, <i>1s. 6d.</i> Table d'Hote Dinner, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> Bed,
<i>2s. 6d.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>


<h3>SLIGO DISTRICT.</h3>

<p class='center'>(<span class="smcap">From Mecredy's Road Book</span>).</p>

<h4>One Day Tour from Sligo. No. 1.</h4>

<p class='center'>Sligo, Dromahaire, 12; Ballysadare, 24; Knockanree Glen, 28; Sligo, 33.</p>

<p>Keeping along the north shore of the lake, Hazlewood Park, 2 miles from
Sligo, is well worth visiting. The public are admitted, and the tourist
should ride right down to the shore, which is here very beautiful. The
road now winds over the hills, and is undulating with fairly good but
rather loose surface, and it is some miles until the lake is reached
again. The scene here is indescribably beautiful, and reminds one
forcibly of Killarney. The lake is studded with islands, and the shores
are densely wooded, whilst northwards extends one of the most
fascinating districts we have ever toured in. It consists of a regular
jumble of mountains, densely wooded, and often most precipitous. The
gapes of the hills are extremely picturesque, and the scene can be
revisited time and again without its palling. Those who would like to
thoroughly explore this lovely neighbourhood should stop at Dromahaire,
where they will find a most excellent hotel, remarkable alike for
moderate charges and a cuisine which could not be surpassed. There is
also an ancient abbey here, well worthy of inspection. Dromahaire is
some little distance from the lake, and on leaving it the road, now
excellent, winds round a mountain, and a few miles farther, after taking
a sharp turn to the right, reaches the lake shore again at its
southern-most point. Farther on it branches inland again, and at a point
2 miles from Sligo a sharp turn to the left has to be taken for
Ballysadare, and if time permits the tourist might proceed on through
Collooney to Mackree Castle (3 miles), which will mean an addition of 6
miles to the day's ride. At Ballysadare there are some really beautiful
waterfalls. Retracing your steps towards Sligo for a short distance,
proceed along the north shore of Ballysadare Bay. The road is good.
Presently it begins to ascend a spur of Knockanree Hill, and a narrow
lane and gate to the right admit to the Glen of the same name. It should
on no account be missed. It is one of the most extraordinary natural
phenomenon we have ever seen, and is exceedingly beautiful besides. It
is very narrow, densely wooded, and the sides are quite precipitous. The
path wanders through a wealth of undergrowth, and in most places we
fancy the Glen is not forty feet wide, while here and there it is much
narrower. In some of these spots the foliage actually meets overhead,
and we noticed in one place a fallen tree had made a natural bridge
across. Just at the beginning of the Glen there is a little glade where
a house once stood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>Keeping-round Knockanree Hill the road comes out on the shore of Sligo
Bay. The surface is excellent, and the scenery pretty right into Sligo.</p>

<h4>One Day Tour from Sligo. No. 2.</h4>

<p class='center'>Sligo, Drumcliff, 5; Carney, 7; Lissadill House, 9; Carney, 11;
Drumcliff, 13; Rathcormack Chapel, 14; Glencar, 18-1/2; Manorhamilton,
27, Sligo, 41.</p>

<p>The road is indifferent for some miles, but gradually improves. At
Drumcliff there is an interesting round tower. Lissadill House is
delightfully situated on the seashore. The grounds are open to the
public, and it is a very pleasant ride through on the well-kept avenues.</p>

<p>Retracing your steps to the main road, after passing Rathcormack Chapel,
turn off to the left for Glencar, along a fairly level by-road, with
fast, but stony, surface. After 2 miles turn to the left again. In due
course Glencar is reached. Keeping along the north shore of the lake an
extraordinary waterfall will be seen on the left. A thin sheet of water
falls from the top of the cliff, and when the wind is from a particular
quarter it catches the falling water every few minutes, and scattering
it in minute particles makes it have the appearance of being suddenly
cut off. Then all of a sudden it comes with a rush again, and apparently
with renewed vigour. It is a very strange phenomenon, and fascinating
withal.</p>

<p>Wheeling along the shores of the lake we come to a larger waterfall at
the extreme extremity, to which our measurement of 18-1/2 miles is
taken. There is a fine volume of water here, and the neighbourhood being
well wooded, gives a pretty effect. A cup of tea can be had at Mr.
Siberry's, hard by.</p>

<p>From this on to Manorhamilton the road, though good, is uninteresting,
but if time presses the cyclist can ride direct back to Sligo, round
Glencar Lake. By adopting this route, however, some beautiful scenery
will be missed, and we should strongly advise following what is known as
the old road from Manorhamilton to Sligo (14). Unless a meal is required
it is better not to go as far as Manorhamilton, but to turn to the
right, 1-1/2 miles out. This will reduce the day's journey by 3 miles.
From this turn there is a stiff climb of 2 miles, but the surface is
good the entire way. At the top of this incline a grand prospect bursts
on the view. A confusion of miniature mountains, densely wooded, extend
in every direction, while, as we descend, the waters of Lough Gill come
into view beneath.</p>

<p>A short distance from the summit the road forks. To the right leads to
Sligo, while the turn to the left runs direct to the lake's shores, and
then joins the other road some miles farther on. Both routes lead
through beautiful scenery. The first is the shortest, but the second the
prettiest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
